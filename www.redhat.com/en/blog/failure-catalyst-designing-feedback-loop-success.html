      content="A few weeks back, Dan Courcy shared the first part of my “origin story” with you in his post The Many Paths to “Hello, World!”. Today, I’m here to share the rest of that story. And, with any luck, I’ll also be able to provide you with some additional insight into how failure can be quite the catalyst that leads to success, when processed as a part of a well-designed feedback loop.Note: If you haven’t read “Harnessing the Power of Feedback Loops” by Thomas Goetz, I highly recommend it. It sets a significant amount of context for the remainder of this article. In episode 4 of Command Line Heroes, “Fail Better,” I reference the phrase “fail fast and break things” and how small incremental steps forward can free teams from a dangerous cycle of blame, and move them towards an environment of continuous learning. To the unindoctrinated, this might sound a bit like the Wild West. In some cases, it may even be true. However, let’s wrap some context around those words and see how it works in practice.In “Harnessing the Power of Feedback Loops,” Thomas Goetz describes 4 distinct stages of a feedback loop that include:Data: An evidence stage in which a behavior must be measured, captured, and stored.Context: A relevance stage in which the data is contextually shared to be emotionally resonant.Consequence: An enlightening stage in which the data illuminates one or more paths forward.Action: A change stage in which an individual recalibrates a behavior, makes a choice, and acts.In the feedback loop, these four stages are critical for forming the correct path toward learning. The stages provide structure—a framework—to experience failure in a well-defined and controlled way. So how did I learn how to use this structure of a feedback loop to further my career? Really, how did I get back into tech after spending an entire summer typing a seemingly endless amount of code only to find it didn’t compile? The answer is similar to many in the tech industry: I didn’t arrive in the “normal way.”Of mice and menYears after my failed first attempt at programming a computer, I decided to attend the University of Connecticut with the intention of becoming a veterinarian. The university, knowing that not everyone who desires to be a vet is cut out for the job, makes first year students take a class that illustrates what is required of veterinary science students in order to graduate. Cutting to the chase: this class involved a cow, and a shoulder-length rubber glove. That’s all it took for this 19-year-old girl to change majors. I used my enthusiasm for an animal psychology class I was taking to make a rash decision to switch to psychology and graduated four years later.So, how am I not a psychiatrist today? The short answer: I don’t like people. The long answer: I wasn’t a very good student and probably wouldn’t have made it through another six years of school.Directly out of college, I used my learnings from statistics and math to become a financial analyst. I discovered that I could make spreadsheets bend to my will. I could automate them by linking them together, pull data from databases, and do far more work than the majority of my colleagues just by using macros to replace repetitive manual tasks. It was this love—the understanding of what I needed the spreadsheet to do, what I needed from the database application, and the ability to communicate those things—that led to my eventual fall from finance and descent into the technical world.Taking animal psychology classes in college taught me the power of observation. Initially it was about observing animals in nature, but as the class work became more advanced, we started observing human behavior. Ultimately, getting that degree in psychology provided the foundation of listening and critical thinking skills that I use today in my current job. It didn’t hurt that I was raised by a man who loved computers. Through interacting with him, I unknowingly adopted much of his language, way of speaking, and way of being around computers that translates directly into how I interact with my colleagues today.Dreaming togetherHow does this all relate to feedback loops? At the same company where I had been a financial analyst, I also experienced my first tech job as a project manager. We muddled about with the waterfall methodology for the first few years, and then the decree came: “Everyone shall do Agile.” It was absolutely the “output over outcome” version of Agile. It really was awful most days. However, when you pushed the conflict aside, a few of us did learn how to work better together.We dreamed together as a team—not about the situation we were in with unattainable test automation and legacy code and design—but about what our intentions were for a perfect system to develop software. We embraced the simple idea that “we are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.”Applying the frameworkUnfortunately, what I didn’t learn during that period of time was to stay present in my career. I was so focused on the internal workings of the team that when I was faced with the prospect of finding another job, I was woefully underskilled in being able to explain how my experience would translate to other companies.It wasn&#039;t that I was under qualified, it was that I didn’t know how to use the terminology of the time to compare what I did to what other companies needed. In retrospect, if I followed what happened using the framework in Thomas Goetz’s article, it would have looked something like this:Evidence (data): I had 6 years of experience in Agile, but was failing to land the jobs I wanted. Interview feedback suggested that my experience wasn’t directly applicable to the company’s needs for which I was interviewing.Emotional Resonance (context): I was turned down by Red Hat for a scrum master position because I wasn’t “qualified enough” even though this is what I had been doing prior to my job search. Red Hat was a fantastic opportunity for me and an opportunity to work on tech at a software company. I really wanted to work there. I longed to work there. (Note: Red Hat saw the error of their ways 4 months later and offered me a position that was hand crafted for my experience. The rest is history. And I’m forever grateful to my hiring manager.)Consequence (path forward): I had two paths I could have taken, one which included pairing with a few coaches to work on my responses to interviewing questions. The other was to work on my resume and make it more relevant to the jobs I was applying for at the time.Action (what we do): I took feedback from a particular interview and worked with a coach friend to restate some of the answers I was giving to questions, specifically focusing on things I actually did in practice rather than the theory of them. The exercise was to make the experience resonate with my “customer” (interviewer) so that they would understand how what I did could be applied to what they needed.While this exercise sounds like it happened quickly (and it did work out for the best in the end), it took me more than a year to find a new job. During this time, I was traveling for work, layoffs were happening every 3-6 months, and a new CIO laid me off upon his arrival (he didn’t want remote workers), but was forced to rehire me 10 hours later by the COO. Mistakes happen, but they have long-term implications on healthy living, and in this case I was in “epic career failure mode” working for a company that sort of valued my work, but only for the output I was producing, not for the outcome I was able to achieve.Failure is importantUltimately, the severity of my situation taught me that I needed to be aware of what was going on in my industry instead of letting things go for as long as I had. Using the concept of shorter feedback loops, I review my professional goals monthly. I made sure to evaluate my career progress, or redefine what I want if my interests changed significantly or something didn’t work out as expected. It’s this process—this feedback loop cycle—and the idea that failure is important in order to learn and grow, that set me on a path for career success today.Interested in learning more about how failure and how failing better has led to some amazing results?

      content="A few weeks back, Dan Courcy shared the first part of my “origin story” with you in his post The Many Paths to “Hello, World!”. Today, I’m here to share the rest of that story.

                                      A few weeks back, Dan Courcy shared the
                                      first part of my &ldquo;origin
                                      story&rdquo; with you in his post

                                      of that story. And, with any luck,
                                      I&rsquo;ll also be able to provide you
                                      with some additional insight into how
                                      failure can be quite the catalyst that
                                      leads to success, when processed as a part
                                      of a well-designed feedback loop.

                                      and how small incremental steps forward

                                      blame, and move them towards an

                                        <strong>Data:</strong> An evidence stage
                                        in which a behavior must be measured,
                                        captured, and stored.

                                        shared to be emotionally resonant.

                                        behavior, makes a choice, and acts.

                                      In the feedback loop, these four stages
                                      are critical for forming the correct path
                                      toward learning. The stages provide
                                      structure&mdash;a framework&mdash;to
                                      experience failure in a well-defined and
                                      controlled way. So how did I learn how to
                                      use this structure of a feedback loop to
                                      further my career? Really, how did I get
                                      back into tech after spending an entire
                                      summer typing a seemingly endless amount
                                      of code only to find it didn&rsquo;t
                                      compile? The answer is similar to many in
                                      the tech industry: I didn&rsquo;t arrive
                                      in the &ldquo;normal way.&rdquo;

                                      Years after my failed first attempt at
                                      programming a computer, I decided to
                                      attend the University of Connecticut with
                                      the intention of becoming a veterinarian.
                                      The university, knowing that not everyone
                                      who desires to be a vet is cut out for the
                                      job, makes first year students take a
                                      class that illustrates what is required of
                                      veterinary science students in order to
                                      graduate. Cutting to the chase: this class
                                      involved a cow, and a shoulder-length
                                      rubber glove. That&rsquo;s all it took for
                                      this 19-year-old girl to change majors. I
                                      used my enthusiasm for an animal
                                      psychology class I was taking to make a
                                      rash decision to switch to psychology and
                                      graduated four years later.

                                      So, how am I not a psychiatrist today? The
                                      short answer: I don&rsquo;t like people.
                                      The long answer: I wasn&rsquo;t a very
                                      good student and probably wouldn&rsquo;t
                                      have made it through another six years of
                                      school.

                                      Directly out of college, I used my
                                      learnings from statistics and math to
                                      become a financial analyst. I discovered
                                      that I could make spreadsheets bend to my
                                      will. I could automate them by linking
                                      them together, pull data from databases,
                                      and do far more work than the majority of
                                      my colleagues just by using macros to
                                      replace repetitive manual tasks. It was
                                      this love&mdash;the understanding of what
                                      I needed the spreadsheet to do, what I
                                      needed from the database application, and
                                      the ability to communicate those
                                      things&mdash;that led to my eventual fall
                                      from finance and descent into the
                                      technical world.

                                      Taking animal psychology classes in
                                      college taught me the power of
                                      observation. Initially it was about
                                      observing animals in nature, but as the
                                      class work became more advanced, we
                                      started observing human behavior.
                                      Ultimately, getting that degree in
                                      psychology provided the foundation of
                                      listening and critical thinking skills
                                      that I use today in my current job. It
                                      didn&rsquo;t hurt that I was raised by a
                                      man who loved computers. Through
                                      interacting with him, I unknowingly
                                      adopted much of his language, way of
                                      speaking, and way of being around
                                      computers that translates directly into
                                      how I interact with my colleagues today.

                                      How does this all relate to feedback
                                      loops? At the same company where I had
                                      been a financial analyst, I also
                                      experienced my first tech job as a project
                                      manager. We muddled about with the
                                      waterfall methodology for the first few
                                      years, and then the decree came:
                                      &ldquo;Everyone shall do Agile.&rdquo; It
                                      was absolutely the &ldquo;output over
                                      outcome&rdquo; version of Agile. It really
                                      was awful most days. However, when you
                                      pushed the conflict aside, a few of us did
                                      learn how to work better together.

                                      We dreamed together as a team&mdash;not
                                      about the situation we were in with
                                      unattainable test automation and legacy
                                      code and design&mdash;but about what our
                                      intentions were for a perfect system to
                                      develop software. We embraced the simple
                                      idea that &ldquo;<em

                                      during that period of time was to stay
                                      present in my career. I was so focused on
                                      the internal workings of the team that
                                      when I was faced with the prospect of
                                      finding another job, I was woefully
                                      underskilled in being able to explain how
                                      my experience would translate to other
                                      companies.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                      It wasn't that I was under qualified, it
                                      was that I didn&rsquo;t know how to use
                                      the terminology of the time to compare
                                      what I did to what other companies needed.
                                      In retrospect, if I followed what happened
                                      using the framework in Thomas
                                      Goetz&rsquo;s article, it would have
                                      looked something like this:

                                      <em>Evidence (data): </em>I had 6 years of
                                      experience in Agile, but was failing to
                                      land the jobs I wanted. Interview feedback
                                      suggested that my experience wasn&rsquo;t
                                      directly applicable to the company&rsquo;s
                                      needs for which I was interviewing.

                                      <em>Emotional Resonance (context):</em> I
                                      was turned down by<em> Red Hat</em> for a
                                      scrum master position because I
                                      wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;qualified
                                      enough&rdquo; even though this is what I
                                      had been doing prior to my job search. Red
                                      Hat was a fantastic opportunity for me and
                                      an opportunity to work on tech at a
                                      software company. I really wanted to work
                                      there. I <em>longed </em>to work there.
                                      (Note: Red Hat saw the error of their ways
                                      4 months later and offered me a position
                                      that was hand crafted for my experience.
                                      The rest is history. And I&rsquo;m forever
                                      grateful to my hiring manager.)

                                      <em>Consequence (path forward):</em> I had
                                      two paths I could have taken, one which
                                      included pairing with a few coaches to
                                      work on my responses to interviewing
                                      questions. The other was to work on my
                                      resume and make it more relevant to the
                                      jobs I was applying for at the time.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                      <em>Action (what we do):</em> I took
                                      feedback from a particular interview and
                                      worked with a coach friend to restate some
                                      of the answers I was giving to questions,
                                      specifically focusing on things I actually
                                      did in practice rather than the theory of
                                      them. The exercise was to make the
                                      experience resonate with my
                                      &ldquo;customer&rdquo; (interviewer) so
                                      that they would understand how what I did
                                      could be applied to what they needed.

                                      While this exercise sounds like it
                                      happened quickly (and it did work out for
                                      the best in the end), it took me more than
                                      a year to find a new job. During this
                                      time, I was traveling for work, layoffs
                                      were happening every 3-6 months, and a new
                                      CIO laid me off upon his arrival (he
                                      didn&rsquo;t want remote workers), but was
                                      forced to rehire me 10 hours later by the
                                      COO. Mistakes happen, but they have
                                      long-term implications on healthy living,
                                      and in this case I was in &ldquo;epic
                                      career failure mode&rdquo; working for a
                                      company that sort of valued my work, but
                                      only for the output I was producing, not
                                      for the outcome I was able to achieve.

                                    <p>
                                      Ultimately, the severity of my situation
                                      taught me that I needed to be aware of
                                      what was going on in my industry instead
                                      of letting things go for as long as I had.
                                      Using the concept of shorter feedback
                                      loops, I review my professional goals
                                      monthly. I made sure to evaluate my career
                                      progress, or redefine what I want if my
                                      interests changed significantly or
                                      something didn&rsquo;t work out as
                                      expected. It&rsquo;s this
                                      process&mdash;this feedback loop
                                      cycle&mdash;and the idea that failure is
                                      important in order to learn and grow, that
                                      set me on a path for career success today.
