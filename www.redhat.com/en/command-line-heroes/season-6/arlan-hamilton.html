                                <p>If you think hard work is enough to guarantee success, you haven’t been listening. All season long, we’ve profiled Black inventors who haven’t quite been given their due. Arlan Hamilton is helping reverse that trend by leveling the playing field&mdash;and changing the venture capital game.
</p>

                                <p class="mb-lg-0">Arlan Hamilton’s story mirrors many we’ve covered this season&mdash;overcoming adversity to find success. But she’s also helping redefine what success can look like and, in the process, is helping change the broader tech industry. Janice Omadeke lays out how diversifying the VC community in turn leads to greater diversity among founders receiving funding. Ramona Ortega explains how traditional VC priorities often pass over startups that can be successful. And Scott Myers-Lipton discusses inequality in Silicon Valley (and beyond) and how he’s working to bring about lasting change.</p>

        <p>Yeah, 2015 was rough. It was the best of times and the worst of times. The first 9, 8, 9 months of it were riddled with housing and food insecurity. I was 34 that year, and I still had that kernel of hope and that little bit of light that was pulling me forward, but it was tough. And then in September of 2015 is when things started to really turn around when I got my first investor. And it gave me that little bit of understanding that yes, I could accomplish what I had set out to do.</p>

        <p>That's Arlan Hamilton. She's a hero of mine. Because from that rough moment, years ago, she managed to build a future that didn't just lift herself up&mdash;it lifted up so many others. Hamilton's a Black and gay woman who's used to confronting other people's expectations. Plenty of people have underestimated her. And they've all been wrong. That year, her roughest year, was also the moment her dream of building a venture capital firm took shape. A venture capital firm that didn't just support the usual Silicon Valley players, but people like her. She wanted to support women and people of color who had brilliant, innovative ideas&mdash;but were facing a lot of locked doors.

And that's why this time, for our season finale, we wanted to feature Arlan Hamilton.

Through her revolutionary VC firm, Backstage Capital, she's been changing the rules around who gets a seat at the table&mdash;and who gets a check.

        <p>My very first investor was a woman named Susan Kimberlin. She is an angel investor in the Bay area who I had met at a 2-week Stanford bootcamp for investors, that I had found my way into. And we just hit it off right away, really got along. I liked her energy; I liked what she stood for. And we spent several weeks and months getting to know each other.

        <p>I think it helped that Susan got to know me. She got to see my consistency over time and hear my thoughts about things, rather than just maybe a deck or a snippet of what I stood for. She was very mission oriented. So that was a few years ago when mission wasn't as much part of the VC vernacular as it is now. For Susan and for other people who came along, who were impact investors first and foremost, they consider their return on investment happening the moment they write the check, as long as it keeps you sustained and lets you go out and see what you can do.</p>

        <p>Susan Kimberlin cut Hamilton a $25,000 check. And that turned out to be an investment in investment itself. Because Hamilton had a plan to pay that money forward. She's seen the statistics. Over 90% of venture capital funding was going to companies led by white men. And only 1% goes to startups fronted by people of color. And Hamilton's simple belief was: white men don't have 90% of the good ideas. Innovation from other people was being squashed. She thought to herself...</p>

        <p>That break-window moment, the change that Hamilton wanted to bring about, was all about choices. The choices that people with money make when they decide who's worthy, who's a good bet. And we know what kind of people usually get chosen. The Ivy league guy, maybe he's a computer science dropout, definitely white. But who was Hamilton looking to invest it?</p>

        <p>I look for someone who reminds me of myself. And sometimes that is a white man across the table, staring at me. But most times it's a person of color, or a woman, or an LGBTQ founder who has made something out of nothing. Who has gone against all odds to get themselves in a position where they're even having the conversation and usually outperforming their peers if they were to be on level playing ground. They are impassioned and they are absolutely going after their dreams and their hopes, but they're not unwieldy in their pursuit. So it doesn’t matter if they've already accomplished a thing or if they just have that glimmer in their eye, so to speak. They may look like there are some rough edges. It doesn’t ping perfect investment on paper, but that's really where you find, it’s between those lines, that you really find the gems.</p>

        <p>While other VC firms chase down unicorns, focusing on big paydays, Hamilton is just as likely to cultivate those sustainable zebras she mentioned&mdash;startups that also plan to be big, but are optimizing for profitability. Whereas a unicorn dazzles and chases giant investments, hoping to be a billion-dollar company, a zebra is quieter, but promises real, long-term value. It's all a part of her larger focus on inclusive venture capitalism that opens the door for a wider range of companies than traditional VCs usually focus on.

        <p>I think there's an interesting problem with a lot of the early-stage capital. And I'll tell you what I think it is. It's that founders of color, particularly women of color who are receiving, I mean, just pennies on the dollar in terms of startup capital to build their companies, when we go to the seed rounds or the institutional seed rounds, we're often being compared in terms of KPIs. These key performance indicators, like how much have you grown, how many users, what's your scalability, all of that. We're being compared to people who've raised a lot more money upfront. And so when you're looking at, okay, who am I going to invest in? If I'm an investor, I want to invest in a company that looks like they have the most traction.</p>

        <p>A lot of times, people of color in tech are meant to feel like they have to have already won to get an investment. Where other folks can be like, “I have an idea. I mean, literally I have just an idea,” and are getting funded or they're super early, don't have a product in market, but people believe in them. What does it take for someone to feel like they believe in someone? And a lot of times that is going to fall into those parameters of like, well, do I trust them? Well, who do you trust? Do you inherently have a bias to trust some people versus others? I mean, there's so much bias built into that relationship. Someone walks in, they recognize you, they see themselves in you.

        <p>What Ortega's describing has created serious roadblocks as people of color seek out traditional VC capital. And that's why it matters so much when a person like Arlan is at that table. Arlan looks at a person like Ortega, and it's easy for her to imagine a success. My Money My Future was, in fact, one of the first 100 companies in Arlan's portfolio. Whereas talking about the racial wealth gap had alienated other investors, it drew Arlan in. And you know, Ortega's startup is just one example. I can't help wondering what our larger tech landscape would look like if there were a whole army of Backstage Capitals. If VC firms could all see the promise in each person who walks through their door.</p>

That injection of cash decades ago allowed tech pioneers to strike out on their own. But, by the same logic, we can ask whether the arrival of Black venture capital has created a more diverse Silicon Valley. Yes, you get support for startups like Ramona Ortega's.

        <p>Back in 2014, tech giants like Apple, Google, and Facebook started producing diversity reports that showed a huge lack of representation of Black and Latinx people&mdash;especially in management. Very few companies have solved this problem. This industry has a long way to go&mdash;and that includes the company that makes this podcast, Red Hat. In fact, when San Jose State University's Human Rights Initiative released its first Silicon Valley Pain Index this year, it showed that tech giants have made little progress in recent years. They found that only 1% of venture capital money was going to Black-led startups. Meanwhile, the percentage of Black employees at the largest tech companies? Just 3%. And many of those don't include a single Black woman.

And that's what we had in King's time, in the 50s and 60s, and sadly, today, that's what we have in Silicon Valley. You have for white folks, $82,800 on average per capita income. For Blacks, it's $40,800. So there it is, two times the number. Half the good for African Americans.</p>

        <p>It probably doesn't help that proactive moves to rectify diversity issues often get called out for being so-called “reverse racism.” Systemic change gets pushed back.

Founder-friendly venture capital might prioritize sustainability, and diverse investment can lead to diverse leadership. But I want to close by reminding you that no VC at all is also an option. There are successful companies like MailChimp that are completely bootstrapped and privately owned—they never felt the need to raise a zillion dollars in funding. Some people get off the ground with just their savings or a loan from a bank. Others build their companies without outside capital, by only relying on the revenue they generate.</p>
