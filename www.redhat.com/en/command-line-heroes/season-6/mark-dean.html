                                <p>Dr. Mark Dean has a superpower. He wasn’t born with it. He wasn’t exposed to high levels of radiation. It’s a power he learned from his father. And because of it, he was able to revolutionize the personal computer.</p>

                                <p>David Bradley explains how in the 1980s, IBM had a reputation for building big, enterprise mainframes. No one believed IBM could make a competitive PC. But that’s exactly what “Project Chess” was tasked with creating. Tony Hey describes the monumental shift in strategy it was for IBM to enter the PC market. Pete Martinez and Dennis Moeller recount their days working with Mark as part of the skunkworks project. And their strategy for creating a computer in under a year changed the personal computing industry forever&mdash;opening it to innovators outside the walls of IBM.
</p>

                                <p class="mb-lg-0">Mark Dean holds 3 of the 9 patents for the IBM 5150&mdash;the first IBM PC&mdash;including the revolutionary ISA bus. He then went on to lead the team that created the first gigahertz microprocessor, and eventually taught at the University of Tennessee. Mwamba Bowa shares her most cherished lesson from the inventor&mdash;how to cultivate that super power for herself.

        <p>It's 1980 and at Bud's bar and Boca Raton, Florida, a dozen computer engineers are milling around, drinking beers, eating pizza, nothing fancy. They're definitely different from the famous showmen of Silicon Valley. But these engineers are about to change the world just as profoundly. By the time they're done, Time Magazine will put their creation on its cover and call it “the person of the year.” But the person just walked in, Mark Dean, he's not even going to be photographed, which is a shame because everything that's about to happen hinges on him.</p>

        <p>All season, we've been tracking some of the inventors and engineers and coding wizards who built our tech future without ever getting famous in the process. And the story of Mark Dean is a classic example. You've maybe never heard of them, but you should have, because when IBM decided to move into the PC market, it was Mark Dean and the team of engineers at Bud's Bar who made it happen. Most of us, when we think about the birth of personal computers, maybe we think about the epic face-off between IBM and Apple. We think about that famous 1984 commercial.</p>

And yet the invention of the integrated circuit had suddenly made computers potentially much smaller. An enormous new market was on the horizon and everyone was racing toward that same goal.</p>

        <p>Project Chess was an experiment by IBM seeing what could be put together by industry components in a very short amount of time. The reason a five-year design cycle or development cycle in IBM, because we used to develop all the parts from scratch. So all of the silicone that had to be developed, all the boxing had to be developed, everything was done from scratch, including the software. What we opted to do says what if we took parts that were off the shelf and started creating a component, a solution, a system, and bypassing all of the development cycle in terms of the guts of it. So it became much more of a systems integration process.</p>

        <p>The original PC had the eight bit bus and the PC/AT took advantage of a couple of important features on the 286, and that was a larger address range. So more memory addressability. We had to expand the bus somehow to expose that so that these add-on devices could be built. And at the same time that we did that, we added some of the additional support for interrupts and DMA channels and a bus master capability. So basically just made a super set of the original PC eight bit bus that was 16 bits wide.</p>

        <p>Allowing a whole industry to supply peripherals and software for the IBM PC had one other effect too. In order to have that kind of modular architecture, you pretty much have to have an open architecture. So the machine's technical information was printed out in a reference manual and handed to the public. IBM in their race to enter the PC market had also edged toward an open source philosophy. IBM's PC/AT supercharged by that 16 bit ISA bus was released in 1984, the same year that Apple produced their famous Orwellian Superbowl commercial.

IBM brought credence and veritas to the personal computer industry. Here's a product that you can trust. Now, IBM also brought out a very open system, which by the way is the way Apple was in 1980, 1981. It wasn't until later with the Macintosh that Apple became a much more closed system, but IBM chose to make a very open system to invite the rest of the industry to participate with us, to build adaptper cards and write software that would run on the IBM personal computer.</p>

                 <h3 class="text-monospace">About the inventor</h3>
                 <p>Dr. Mark Dean is Emeritus Professor at <a href="http://www.eecs.utk.edu/people/mark-dean/" class="text-white"><u>University of Tennessee</u></a>. He started learning about engineering from his father, who was self-taught. He knew from a young age that <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/08/26/personal-computer-ibm-inventor-technology-engineer/32370191/" class="text-white"><u>he wanted to work at IBM</u></a>&mdash;a dream that he fulfilled soon after graduating from college. At IBM, he developed the ISA bus, and later worked on the team that created a one-gigahertz computer processor chip. He’s earned over 40 patents throughout his career. After retiring from the corporate world, Mark Dean started teaching at the University of Tennessee, where he passes on his superpower to his students.</p>

                 <h3 class="text-monospace pt-xl-2">About the invention</h3>
                            
                <p>It only took a year to create <a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/pc25/pc25_birth.html" class="text-white"><u>the IBM 5150</u></a>. Started as a skunkworks project in Boca Raton, Florida, the 5150 was the result of a drastic shift in how IBM built hardware. It introduced an open philosophy of design and compatibility as well. And IBM’s entry into the PC market made waves; enough for <a href="http://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/37-years-ago-steve-jobs-ran-apples-most-amazing-ad-heres-story-its-almost-been-forgotten.html" class="text-white"><u>Apple to take out an ad “welcoming” IBM to the marketplace</u></a>. But the 5150 was more than a first attempt at a PC&mdash;<a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/06/ibm-pc-history-part-1/" class="text-white"><u>it changed the personal computer forever</u></a>.</p>
