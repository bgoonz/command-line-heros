                                <p>Aristotle and Erastosthenes are big names in geodesy. They got pretty close to measuring the size of the Earth. But the woman who got it done? She grew up a farmer, dreaming of something bigger. And her work changed how we see the world.
</p>

                                <p>Dr. Gladys West didn’t have much room for error in her quest for higher education. Marvin Jackson recounts the obstacles in her path—and the challenges she faced in her early career. Gavin Schrock traces how geodesy progressed before Dr. West, and how foundational her work was for the GPS systems that followed. Paul Ceruzzi describes the state-of-the-art technology available at Dahlgren that helped Dr. West model the world. Todd Humphreys explains how that model, and the GPS systems that use it, support our way of life in more ways than we realize.

She makes the case for telling these stories before they’re lost&mdash;because there are definitely more of them out there.</p>

        <p>Third Century BCE. In the Great Library of Alexandria, the Chief Librarian, Eratosthenes, is about to have his breakthrough. Eratosthenes is an astronomer, a historian, a poet, and right now he's a cartographer too. Using just the shadows cast by sticks in the sand and a few geographical records he discovered in his library, he has managed to calculate the circumference of the planet. Even though the ancient Greeks were unaware of whole continents, Eratosthenes’s calculations were off by less than 2%. The world, the whole world, had suddenly snapped into focus.</p>

This time we're zooming in on a mathematician who helped bring definition to the 197 million square miles that we call home. Gladys West was a pioneer in the field of geodesy. That's where scientists and mathematicians work to build more and more accurate models of the planet. That model is crucial to our daily lives. Because in helping to build that model, Gladys West didn't just show us what the mountains and oceans of planet earth look like.</p>

        <p>Dr. West wasn't just going to college either. After graduating in 1952, she got a job teaching math at a segregated school. She saved her income, so she could return for a master's degree in mathematics at Virginia State University, a historically Black institution. Then destiny came knocking in 1956. She was invited to come work as a mathematician at the Naval Proving Ground at Dahlgren, an institution that had just been desegregated.</p>

Very precise navigation was not going to be possible until they figured this out. There were too many discrepancies.

To be able to get GPS to be able to measure, initially they just wanted plus or minus 10 meters, was the charter for the US Air Force. If you want it to measure to a meter, or nowadays because the geodesy is so well-refined, you can measure to the centimeter and even over a time series, say structural monitoring, down to millimeters.

        <p>I call her&mdash;my term is “recently recognized,” because she basically was always there, but now she's being recognized for all the hard work she did. I just think that it's important that we recognize people like Gladys and the contributions they made. I mean, and they did it at an even more difficult time than now. And so that should give young girls a reason to be more positive about doing these types of things, because it will be a lot easier for them now to do these things than when it was for Gladys.

        <p>Later, West would build on early GPS breakthroughs by contributing to the Geosat Satellite Mission in the 1980s, where she helped determine the height of oceans down to the inch. And even when her 42-year career had ended, she remained a fanatic for precision and for excellence at levels that most of us never even contemplate. After retiring in 1998, West went on to get her doctor of philosophy degree in public administration at the age of 70. She was the only Black woman in her program. And just this last summer, she published her memoir entitled, <i>It Began With a Dream</i>.</p>

                 <p>Dr. Gladys West is a mathematician, and earned a PhD in Public Administration from Virginia Tech.  Her mathematical modeling of the shape of the earth, and contributions to satellite geodesy models, contributed to the development of the Global Positioning System (GPS). West was inducted into the <a href="http://www.afspc.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/1707464/mathematician-inducted-into-space-and-missiles-pioneers-hall-of-fame/" class="text-white"><u>United States Air Force Hall of Fame in 2018</u></a>.

                <p>The Global Positioning System that the world relies on today doesn’t work without an accurate model of the earth. Using satellite data, advanced mathematics, and state-of-the-art computers, <a href="http://www.xyht.com/gnsslocation-tech/dr-gladys-west/" class="text-white"><u>Dr. West calculated the most accurate model of the Earth up to that point</u></a>. Those models, in tandem with the GPS, help determine position on the Earth up to the nearest centimeter. It’s <a href="http://fredericksburg.com/lifestyles/gladys-wests-work-on-gps-would-impact-the-world/article_26e82f21-bb5a-5d76-9789-69a5039ad018.html" class="text-white"><u>technology that the whole world uses</u></a>, every second of every day.
