A decade later, Clarence Ellis became the first Black person to earn a PhD in computer science in America ever. He didn't put it to work at the Dover Corporation, though. He cast his net wider. Because the boy who wasn't allowed to touch the computer was going to help millions make contact with computers of their own.

        <p>In 1968, Douglas Engelbart delivered what was later named the Mother of All Demos. Stanford Research Institute was showing off a prototype machine that included windows, hypertext, graphics, word processing &mdash; all the humanizing elements of computing that we take for granted today. Engelbart's demo became a rallying cry for a whole new age of computing, an age where computers stopped being abstract machines that only a few professionals could interface with. Instead, these computers met humans on their own level. Dr. Martez Mott from Microsoft Research explains how the mother of all demos inspired computer scientists like Clarence Ellis to look beyond the command-line interface that had dominated their work.

There were two groups at PARC: The Computer Science Lab focused on horizontal technology—they invented the Alto, the Bravo editor, the desktop, and icons. All that graphic user interface (GUI) stuff that Steve Jobs found so attractive.  There was a lot of overlap between the teams, and those who were there say Clarence Ellis contributed crucial elements to the GUI work, helping out on the creation of icons and the visual of desktop.</p>

        <p>For example, this early attempt was tackling sending that invoice down a pipeline of computerized steps, instead of wasting hours of human labor shuffling paper around an office. But they were scraping the surface of a much, much larger problem. When you start asking multiple workstations to coordinate their work, new technical roadblocks suddenly emerge. Their system could track a job as it moved from person to person, but each transaction had to exist as an “atomic transaction”, sealed off on its own and pausing the whole system. There was no real time concurrency. And that missing ingredient, the ability to co-edit in real-time, was going to become the holy grail of collaborative software.</p>

        <p>The term groupware was coined in 1978 by Peter and Trudy Johnson-Lenz. And their definition pointed towards something pretty profound. Groupware was going to create a computer-mediated culture. It would be, in their words, “an embodiment of social organization in cyberspace.” That was what Clarence Ellis was chasing when he arrived at MCC. But the roadblock was still there. Without an embodiment of social organization, where one person's actions interact seamlessly with another's… well, it wasn't going to happen.</p>

        <p>At MCC, Ellis dove into theory to solve the problem. How could multiple users work in a single space, a document for example, without having their actions interfere with each other? The breakthrough came in 1989 when Ellis and his fellow MCC colleague, Simon Gibbs, wrote a paper describing what they called Operational Transformation, or OT. A new algorithm was proposed that allowed for total concurrency control. In other words, with Operational Transformation, you could have multiple users editing a document simultaneously, and the changes wouldn't trip each other up.</p>

        <p>OT was the underlying technology for supporting real time co-editing. Real time requires that users see each other's edits, character by character in text editing instantly.

        <p>It sounds pretty straightforward, but the implications are enormous. With real-time co-editing, new operations become possible. OT resolves conflicts among multiple operations that target the same piece of text. It maintains consistency between multiple instances of the document. It allows for group undo and operation compression. And we should point out that all this was made possible without any really complex communication protocols, which means OT technology could mask any network latency.

We forget how radical it was just a couple of decades ago. When Ellis and his peers first proposed these kinds of platforms, some people freaked out. The whole idea of collaborative editing for example: everybody reading and writing at the same time? Chaos! But Ellis was able to imagine a new shared workspace. He imagined it being a whole mode of working that didn't yet exist. And I can't imagine living without it.</p>

        <p>A large part of my job involves helping inspire kids about computer science. The subject has always had this stereotype that computer scientists are very white, male, when that isn't actually the reality. So, I started looking for role models that I could write about. And so I just stumbled across the story of Clarence Ellis and was really surprised that I hadn't actually heard of him before. So I think he ought to be a lot more well-known. I mean, to be involved in both graphical user interfaces being designed, and collaborative editing tools, being at the forefront of both of those different technologies is in itself pretty amazing.</p>

In fact, DeMers had no idea what her dad had accomplished when she was younger. Later in his life though, after his days at Xerox PARC and after he'd left MCC, she saw Ellis continue that same work &mdash; the work of bringing people together, letting them collaborate, and finding a human-centered approach to computers. And she saw her dad do that work in a profound new way.</p>

He would also teach a dance class in the evening&mdash;if students wanted to come, they could. It was like an extracurricular activity, I guess.

Clarence Ellis had come a long way from the graveyard shift at Dover Manufacturing, he was a global citizen and a Fulbright scholar. As his daughter mentioned, Ellis would fly back and forth to Africa, Ghana especially, the home of his ancestors. He wanted to keep lifting people up and bringing them together&mdash;a mission that had characterized his whole career. Then on May 17, 2014 on the flight back home from Ghana, Ellis died unexpectedly at age 71. </p>
        <p>Oh yeah&mdash;and Ellis didn't just open up to the academic community. He made other connections in a “folk” community that some of his old computer science colleagues might never have guessed.</p>

From there, he worked at prestigious research institutions like Bell Labs, Xerox PARC, the Micro&mdash;electronics and Computer Technology Corporation (MCC), and more. After his career in the private sector, he continued conducting research while also teaching the University of Colorado Boulder.

                <p>Operational Transformation is the technology behind OfficeTalk&mdash;and later, <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/wave/whitepapers/operational-transform/operational-transform.html" class="text-white"><u>Google Wave and Google Docs</u></a>. It’s the framework that helps computers decide how to make sense of and logically execute multiple sources of input for a single document, like when several users are typing, deleting, and otherwise editing a document at the same time. Without it, we’d likely still be stuck editing documents one at a time.</p>
