                                <p>Sometimes an inventor designs a device for a specific purpose. Sometimes it’s to try something new. But successful inventions often shape industries beyond those they initially intended.  Dr. Marc Hannah built an invention with far bigger effects than anyone could have imagined—like bringing dinosaurs to life, building liquid robots, and letting the Titanic set sail one more time.</p>

                                <p class="mb-lg-0">Raqi Syed gives some context with the evolution of special effects in the movie industry. Mark Grossman explains how the graphics world was more than ready for an upgrade. Tom Davis recounts the difficulties that he and his team  had getting people to understand what was possible with the Geometry Engine. Luckily, Steve “Spaz” Williams defied his bosses and showed them its power to bring worlds to life, starting with the world of Jurassic Park. Camille Cellucci explains that from then on, everything changed for the movie industry—and for the broader world of graphics.

        <p>2001: A Space Odyssey is really important because Doug Trumbull, the VFX (video effects) supervisor on that film, was really interested in building upon what was called slit-scan technology. He built this machine, which was probably made out of bespoke IBM computers. It was as big as a room. It was 30 feet by 30 feet, and it was a giant machine that they ran for months in order to get what came to be known as the famous Star Gate sequence.</p>

        <p>It's a chip and an architecture. It's a multiprocessor architecture. So you have several copies of this Geometry Engine chip arranged in a pipeline, each one connected to the next, and it's performing the mathematical calculations that are required to take a 3D description of objects and their placement within this virtual environment, and mapping that onto a screen representation. There are kind-of three major steps associated with that. The set of transformations of the vertices, these are sort of polygonal representations, joining triangles. You have to map the vertices into their position in this virtual world space. That second step is to clip out the parts of the image that are outside of what the camera would be seeing. And then the final step is to map that clipped version of what you're viewing into the 2D screen space. There's a scaling to the screen dimensions, screen coordinates, and a perspective division so that the things farther away look smaller. Those are kind-of the three major steps in this geometry pipeline.</p>

If they succeeded, it would supercharge the mathematical operations that make it possible to display and manipulate 3D graphics, and they’d dramatically bring down costs at the same time.</p>

        <p>When I started working with Jim, this idea of systems designers doing custom chips was just starting to happen, which meant that you could design a custom chip that performed a lot of the functions that previously required multiple chips and some expensive chips. So, in volume, you can get the cost of things down and still provide very high performance. That idea of doing custom silicon, as opposed to just putting together standard off-the-shelf chips, was really critical to bring down the cost of this computing.</p>

        <p>Yeah, actually we rented out, there was a movie theater across the street from where SGI was. A bunch of SGI employees went over to watch the movie, and I remember one scene in particular, I think it was when the velociraptor is running through the kitchen or something like that. You're into the movie, there's all this tension and so forth, and at the end of the scene, it just struck me that all those dinosaurs were computer generated and they just looked incredibly real. You wanted it to look like a real dinosaur, and it really did.</p>

        <p>Suddenly, investing in 3D graphics was a pretty sure bet, and that meant everybody needed an SGI machine. Remember that prediction Hannah made for Fortune magazine, a billion dollars a year? Well, one decade after they launched, Silicon Graphics made that billion. Waves of competitors were nipping at their heels. Companies like Sun, HP, and Apollo. But SGI was the behemoth in the field. By the mid-90s, they seemed untouchable with thousands of employees on several continents and an 11-building headquarters in the heart of Silicon Valley. But then again, even T-Rex seemed indomitable before that comet came crashing out of the sky.</p>

        <p>Marc Hannah's breakthrough–using the Geometry Engine to lower pricing so that more customers had access to enormous computing power–had created a heyday in film. There were moments in the 90s–when the liquid chrome T-1000 first appeared in Terminator 2, when those dinosaurs barreled their way through Jurassic Park–those were extraordinary film moments that leapt ahead of audience expectations in a way that hasn't really happened since. But SGI's role as this kingpin of graphics couldn't last forever. As PC-based graphics cards improved and chips got faster and faster, SGI's business model weakened. Cheaper options wooed customers away. Hannah saw that PCs were becoming more and more powerful. Meanwhile, SGI's high-end workstations ranging from $50,000 to $200,000 weren't going to be as attractive down the road.</p>

        <p>There would be no growth there. We needed to evolve into higher-end systems that were defined as servers, where even for the graphics, you do most of the work in these modular servers and then you just send the bits down the wire. Initially, at that time in the mid-90s, the enterprise networks, the local area networks used within companies were fast enough, I felt, that you could just send pixels down and centralize and you didn't have issues associated with all these high-end workstations in terms of cost and maintenance and so forth. Then once wide area networks, of course, became faster, then you could move it further out of the enterprise, and I guess what is currently known as cloud computing. There's no need for these really expensive desktops. Strategically, I didn't think it was happening, and we acquired Cray.</p>

        <p>Jim Clark was also wary of the rising PC market and its ability to take over from SGI workstations. He made his exit in 1994. As for Marc Hannah, well, he saw the writing on the wall, too, and left Silicon Graphics in 1997. He took with him 13 patents for work on graphics processing, pixel mapping, and texture mapping. And he was right about that death spiral, by the way. Maya, the 3D software, was released one year later, and other companies kept reaching up, offering some of what Hannah's machines managed at lower prices. SGI's monopoly continued to erode, and on April Fool's Day, 2009, they filed for bankruptcy.</p>
