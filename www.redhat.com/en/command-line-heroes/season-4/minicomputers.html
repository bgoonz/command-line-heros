                                <p>They don’t fit in your pocket. But in their day, minicomputers were an order of magnitude smaller than the room-sized mainframes that preceded them. And they paved the way for the personal computers that could fit in a bag and, eventually, the phones in your pocket.</p>

                                <p>16-bit minicomputers changed the world of IT in the 1970s. They gave companies the opportunity for each engineer to have their own machines. But it wasn’t quite enough, not until the arrival of 32-bit versions.</p>

                                <p class="mb-lg-0">Carl Alsing and Jim Guyer recount their work at Data General to create a revolutionary new 32-bit machine. But their now legendary work was done in secret. Codenamed “Eagle,” their machine was designed to compete with one being built by another team in their own company. These engineers recall the corporate politics and intrigue required to keep the project going—and how they turned restrictions into advantages. Neal Firth discusses life on an exciting-but-demanding project. One where the heroes worked together because they wanted to, without expectations of awards or fame. And all three discuss how this story was immortalized in the non-fiction engineering classic, The Soul of a New Machine by Tracy Kidder.</p>

        <p>The year was 1978 and a battle was raging in the mini-computer industry. Just a year earlier, Digital Equipment Corporation released its 32-bit VAX 11 780 computer. It was much more powerful than the 16-bit machines in the market. Sales of the VAX quickly overtook their slower competition. Archrival, Data General, was desperate for a new machine to compete with the VAX. They needed a 32-bit computer of their own and they needed it fast, but that competition between Data General and DEC wasn't the only battle going on. There was also a turf war brewing inside Data General and the spoils of both wars would be the creation of an incredible machine under incredible circumstances. A 13-inch laptop weighs maybe three pounds. We take for granted our computers’ portability and convenient size, but back in the 70s, most computers were still room-sized mainframes, multi-million dollar machines weighing several tons. Then, when hardware costs plummeted, the race to smaller, faster, cheaper machines began. The mini computer opened the door for engineers and scientists to have a terminal of their own. It was the machine that led us to where we are today.</p>

        <p>Last season on Command Line Heroes, we took a deep dive into an area that is central to software development, the world of programming languages. We looked at their history, the problems they solved, and how they've evolved over time. Languages like JavaScript, Python, and C, Perl, COBOL, and Go. This season, season four for those of you counting, we are diving deep again, this time into the hardware that our software runs on. We're going to tell you seven special stories about the people and teams who dared to change the rules of hardware. That laptop on your desk, that phone in your pocket, command line heroes put their soul into every piece of hardware you've owned and heroes before them. Their passion for building their bold moves to make our hardware a reality has revolutionized the way we program today.</p>

        <p>Back to Data General. Company president, Ed de Castro, hatches a plan to compete with DEC. He splits up the engineering department, moving a team from its Westboro, Massachusetts headquarters to a new office in North Carolina. Their assignment? Develop an advanced 32-bit design that would crush the VAX. They named their project, Fountainhead. De Castro gave the team almost unlimited support and resources. Fountainhead was going to be his company's savior. The few remaining engineers left behind in Massachusetts, they felt seriously slighted. They knew they could build a VAX killer, probably a better one than what Fountainhead could build, but de Castro wouldn't give them a chance. So the leader of that group, Tom West, decided to take matters into his own hands. A self-taught computer engineer, Tom West ran Data General's Eclipse division. Eclipse was data General's most successful line of 16-bit mini computers. Tom could build machines, he could ship them, and he knew what the market wanted. After setting up Fountainhead, de Castro told the remaining engineers to keep working on improving last year's product line. Tom and the others were unimpressed.</p>

        <p>This'll be a whole new design using the latest techniques, build a 32-bit computer that would beat the DECs’ VAXs. So we put together a proposal for that and went to the president, Ed de Castro, and he says, "Nope, no way. No, the North Carolina groups taking care of that. You don't have to worry about it." So we were discouraged and we went back and came up with another proposal called Victor. We looked at ways of making the old last year's product better. And we had in there a little switch, a mode bit in the system, that when you turned it on, it would enable the computer to act like a modern 32-bit mini computer, although slow. And we took that to Ed de Castro and proposed it. And at the end he said, "You have a mode bit in here. I don't want to see any design with a mode bit. North Carolina's taking care of the new designs." So again, we were discouraged and I think this is when Tom West decided that we were going to do something clandestine.</p>

        <p>Tom came up with two stories. One was for de Castro. They would work on an enhancement of the old Eclipse product line, make it a little faster, add a few new buttons, a different color. Tom pitched it as insurance just in case something went wrong in North Carolina. De Castro approved it. And then Tom told another story, a better story to his team.</p>

        <p>So Tom West proposed to a few of us in the team that we build a really good modern machine that's completely compatible with the previous machines and did all the latest high tech stuff that we needed and virtual memory and 32-bits and error correcting codes and all those kinds of things. Multitasking, multiprocessing, lots of memory. "Guys, we're going to build the latest market-killing new machine."</p>

        <p>The code name for this market-killing new machine, was the Eagle. Nowadays, it feels like there's no limit to what you can do with the memory built into our computers, but back then, a big breakthrough happened when 16-bits gave way to 32-bits. All of a sudden, your address space went from 65,000 bytes of information to over 4 billion. And with that increase, software could deal with larger amounts of data. That left computer companies with two basic challenges: transitioning from 16-bits to 32-bits, sure, but they also had to keep their old customers, the ones using the old software, happy. So, they had to create a machine that would keep old software running, a 32-bit computer that could be backward compatible. The VAXs, for all its power, didn't have an elegant solution to that second problem, but Tom was determined that his Eagle would.</p>

There's a difference between designing a product that's safe, risk-free, and a product that's going to win. And we were not worried about risk. We were worried about winning.

        <p>At the time, it was quite a ways into the project, and we were running the microcode simulator, and it was actually running what was proposed to be the production simulator, and it had been running for about 10, 12 hours. And all of a sudden, the letter E shows up on the console and then we waited a little while and another letter, then another letter, and then we suddenly realized what we were running for test code was the diagnostics that were being designed to run. And so the microcode simulator was simulating the hardware running this microcode, and it was starting to print characters as if it was actually operating. So, it was maybe a hundred thousand times slower than real life, when it actually came out and operated, but that was one of my most memorable moments.</p>

        <p>Key to making something truly great. Interesting question. I think it depends on the people involved doing it, because they want to, not because they have expectations of achievement, or wealth or fame. Because those things are very fleeting and almost never satisfied. But if you're going in trying to achieve a goal, and you and a bunch of people work together on it and achieve it, that really is satisfaction when you achieve that.</p>
