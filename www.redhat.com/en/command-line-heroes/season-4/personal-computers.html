                                <p>The Altair 8800 is why we have computers in most homes today. It was initially designed for hobbyists. But a few visionaries saw massive potential in this strange little machine—and worked hard to make others see it too. What they created led to so much more than anyone could have ever imagined.</p>

                                <p class="mb-lg-0"><strong>Forrest Mims</strong> tells us how his co-founder, Ed Roberts, planned to save their struggling electronics company. His idea? A microcomputer made for hobbyists. That computer led to a fateful phone call from Bill Gates and Paul Allen. <Strong>Dan Sokol and Lee Felsenstein</strong> recall the unveiling of the Altair 8800 at the Homebrew Computer Club, and how it sparked Steve Wozniak’s eureka moment for the Apple I. We then hear from <strong>John Markoff</strong> about an infamous software heist that set the stage for the debate about whether code should be proprietary. And finally, <strong>Limor Fried</strong> reflects on how this story continues to influence today’s open source hardware movement.</p>

        <p>As the men pass a newsstand, they see the blue lettering of Popular Electronics peeking out from the other magazines. They stop and check it out. On the cover is a photo of a metal box, with a dozen switches and small lights on the front. The headline reads, "World's first minicomputer kit. Altair 8800." The box doesn't look like much. Bare bones really, meant for hobbyists and tinkerers. But it looked like something more to these two guys. It looked like the machine they'd been waiting for, because they had the perfect software for this new hardware. At the same time, they were a little freaked out. What if others had the same idea they did and were working on it already? They had to move fast. The names of those two command line heroes? Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Little did they know that the Altair 8800 would be the gateway machine to a personal computer revolution. It would change their lives, and ours, forever. That new machine would do one other thing. It would kickstart the debate between free and proprietary software, with the help of a mysterious thief. Stay tuned.</p>

       <p>Let's go back to the late '60s. Out to the New Mexico desert, where the Altair 8800 was born. A man named Ed Roberts had co-founded a small electronics parts company, MITS, which stood for Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems. Through hobbyist magazines, they could sell gadgets to the new market obsessed with radio controlled airplanes and model rockets.</p>

       <p>Ed's goal was to create a very basic computer kit, for the same hobbyist market that had been into model airplanes and rockets. He would sell it mail order through Popular Electronics Magazine. When you received the kit, inside would be a bag full of metal parts, including a special tube that contained the all-important Intel 8080 microprocessor chip. Ed priced the whole kit at around $400.</p>

       <p>He had one question. He said, "How many do you think will sell?" Based on all the previous things that we sold through Popular Electronics, I said, "Well Ed, golly. Maybe a few hundred." He looked so sad when I said that. To this day I feel guilty. After that was in Popular Electronics Magazine, his parking lot in front of their little building was jammed with cars. They sold 5000 of those computers. It was named the Altair 8800. The name was dreamed up by the staff at Popular Electronics Magazine. Ed didn't know what to call it.</p>

       <p>The Altair 8800 was Ed Roberts' hail mary move to save his company, and it was the best decision he'd ever make. He didn't realize it at the time, but he'd done something truly significant. Because by placing the Altair in the open market, at an affordable price, he'd exposed his machine to a much larger audience than the hardcore electronic hobbyist crowd. His Altair opened up the potential for a whole new group of consumers—those who never imagined they could own a computer of their own.</p>

       <p>There was someone else at that inaugural meeting. When he saw the Altair, it blew his mind, but not because he couldn't believe a machine like that existed. Quite the opposite. Because a machine like that, and much more than that, already existed. He'd built it. That man was the young Steve Wozniak. A friend of his had coaxed him to go to that meeting so that Steve could show off a video terminal he built. But everyone was fixated on the Altair instead. Steve had never heard of it. And he also hadn't heard of the Intel 8080 microprocessor that was making it hum. So he took home a datasheet, and it led to an incredible eureka moment.</p>

       <p>In our last episode, we learned how Woz started writing his own software in BASIC on the GE-225 computer in high school. Well, ever since high school, Woz had wanted a computer all his own. But to do that, he had to include a programming language that meant dedicating at least 4K of memory and human input and output to type in the programs. His machine had 256 bytes of solid state RAM and the chips for that were really expensive. So he designed a processor, refining it over and over while still in high school. It had switches to enter in ones and zeros, just like the Altair. But now he realized the Altair's microprocessor was the culmination of his vision.</p>

       <p>That night, the image of the Apple 1 popped into Steve Wozniak's head. He could build his own fully usable computer for next to nothing by adding in a microprocessor to his terminal. And he had this idea that when his computer started up, it would run a program that would take in data that you typed into it, like a typewriter. No more switching ones and zeros. Add to that the video terminal he’d built to let programmers see what they were typing in and voila, a computer that felt more human. A useful personal computer that worked for normal people.

       <p>He had already developed a little video terminal kind of adapter, which the generic term was a TV typewriter. You would hook it to a TV. And he was introduced to the processor chip, which was being sold for $25 each, and realized, "If I put this on a board with some memory, I could put that TV terminal on the board, too, and I'd have a computer that would have a video display," which he did and he was working on that while he would be in the meetings. When we moved to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Auditorium, he grabbed the only seat with an electrical outlet. He would always be there before everyone else. He was writing the BASIC program for the Apple 1. He started the Apple family of computers there.</p>

       <p>Once Woz finished building his computer, he was excited to show everyone at the club. He explained how a handful of chips could make an affordable personal computer.

       <p>So at the end of the meeting, he passed out the blueprints to his design, the hardware and the software, for free to everyone. He figured they could each use his plans to build their own $300 computer. But Woz's friend and business partner, a guy named Steve Jobs, quickly put an end to that idea. You see, Jobs had been traveling all this time and didn't realize Woz was giving away the design to the Apple 1. Jobs didn't share Woz's hacker mindset. He was more proprietary. Jobs soon convinced Woz that they should sell the computers instead.</p>

It happened in the auditorium of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. At the end of that meeting, dozens of attendees rushed the stage to collect a program on paper tape, fresh copies of Microsoft's Altair BASIC, the new software that everyone was excited about.</p>

The only piece of functional software was this BASIC interpreter, which pretty much acted as an operating system. There was no such thing as an operating system back in 1974 in these personal computers, and we couldn't get through to him.

       <p>The Homebrew Computer Club, I think, had that philosophy where people were coming in with their computers, and it was a little bit like, "Check this cool hack I did," and then everyone was like, "Damn, that's cool. Okay, next month I got to bring something better." And that is a positive feedback cycle that brings really good technological innovation. I think that hacker philosophy still exists. People have just more background and so what they think of as a cool hack has really, I want to say improved, but it has diffused, and I think that's good. But I think the values of sharing are still there and helping each other and working together and cooperation. That thread has passed through. I mean, it's in the entire open source community.</p>
