                                <p>The floppy disk was one of the greatest breakthroughs in computing. It helped spin up the software industry with a format that endured for decades. And in some cases, it’s conserved treasures once thought to be lost forever.</p>

                                <p>Before floppy disks came along, computing was weighed down by punch cards and magnetic tapes. Steven Vaughan-Nichols describes the magnitude of the changes brought by the floppy disk. Dave Bennet explains how the need for permanent storage, which was also easily mailable, led to the first 8-inch drives. George Sollman recalls how he was tasked with creating a smaller floppy, and what unexpected sources inspired the next design. And when Sollman showed it to the HomeBrew Computer Club, a couple of this season’s usual suspects asked him to see more. And the rest is history.</p>

                                <p class="mb-lg-0">Or is it? Matthew G. Kirschenbaum points out that floppy disks are still in use in some unexpected places. And Jason Scott and Tony Diaz tell us how they brought some source code from the sneakernet to the cloud.</p>

When the personal computing revolution took off, which we heard about in our last episode on the Altair 8800, there was one piece of technology that became synonymous with saving. The floppy disk. It seems so simple now. But floppies changed the course of our history. Because they helped turn microcomputers into personal computers.</p>

       <p>Our first stop, 1890. Before electronic computers existed, there were electrical mechanical computing devices. The method for getting data in and out of them was through punch cards the size of a dollar bill. When electronic computers came along in the '50s, IBM standardized those punch cards with 80 columns, and 12 rows. A punched hole would form one type of character. No hole meant another.</p>

       <p>Next up, paper tape. Which came along in the 1950s. To hear how paper tape played a central role in the origin of personal computing, listen to our last episode. Paper tape had the same punched hole method of reading data as punch cards. But because it's all one tape, no one had to worry about getting cards mixed up. It could carry more data, and was much faster to use. But as minicomputers grew in capacity, they needed more and more tape to store programs. Like punch cards, paper tape eventually met its limit.</p>

       <p>Enter magnetic tape. The key ingredient was mylar, a tough, flexible material coated with magnetic oxide to make the tape recordable. Nine tracks could store up to 175 megabytes per tape. That was a big deal in the '50s and '60s. Magnetic tape drives of 10.5-inch reels became standard issue for businesses.</p>

       <p>Interesting thing. That disk drive almost didn't see the light of day, because it threatened IBM's punch card business. But the project was eventually approved. Problem was, the drive contained disks made of solid metal. RAMAC literally weighed a ton. It had to be moved with forklifts, and transported by large cargo planes. Not the most convenient storage method. But out of that, came a better solution.</p>

       <p>While the floppy disk was originally developed for a new need. The reason was that there was an intermediate kind of storage. Originally there was the computer code, and then there was the computer memory, the working memory. But with System 360, there was a new class of memory in between, which they called firmware. In System 360, there was unique technology for the firmware in various forms. It was either a special kind of a punched card, or there was a thing called transformer read-only storage.</p>

       <p>Now what they actually had to do in order to make it mailable was, they decided to put it in a plastic container that was fairly rigid. They would actually read and write the disk while it was inside of this plastic container, like an envelope. A plastic envelope. When you have a coating on a disk and a rigid head, you're going to have wear. When you have wear, you have wear particles.</p>

We put together a plain old garden variety flip chart that described what it was, and we took it back and met with Dr. Wang, who said, “I like it, but you cannot use a motor in it that uses AC current because you're going to distort the image.”</p>

       <p>Steve Jobs hated the cassette drives in Apple's early computers. They were always failing and took forever to go back and forth to get information. For the Apple II, he wanted a floppy disk drive and Steve Wozniak wanted to build it, but size was key. The floppy had to be shrunk down to make the computer more compelling to customers. So in a 2-week span over the Christmas holidays in 1977, subsisting mainly on a diet of McDonald's, Woz built the prototype. It was done in time for the new year's Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas.</p>

       <p>If you bought an Apple II, this was an option that very quickly became wildly popular. Really, you can give Steve Jobs the credit for being the person to introduce the floppy drive to the PC world. People are running this operating system called CPM 80 and there are literally dozens of small manufacturers and some big ones like DEC making CPM 80 computers and all of these computers use the 5.25-inch floppy drive. And then when IBM comes along in 1981 with the first IBM PC, it has become clear to everyone that this is no longer a hobbyist market.</p>

       <p>The floppy disk and the personal computer revolution were symbiotic. One fueled the other and vice versa. They evolved together. Thanks to the floppy, companies could write programs, copy them onto disks and sell them through the mail or in stores. It did for early PCs what app stores would do for smartphones, opening things up for developers. In fact, the floppy made the whole software industry possible, and as those software programs became larger and more complex, floppies changed again. In 1981, Sony introduced the next evolution of the floppy disk shrunk down to 3.5 inches.</p>

       <p>Well, we all know about Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. The creators of the floppy drives, like Shugart, are not household names by any means, but the work they did was absolutely vital. If it wasn't for that, PCs would have been adopted much more slowly. It's impossible for me to see how the PC revolution could have happened the way it did without these early drives. It just made getting data in and out of computers an order of magnitude easier than it would have been otherwise.</p>

       <p>Because floppies were hand-sized and easily shareable, they had a social quality, like an early form of social media. You could meet up with people and trade disks. This was before people had easy access to modems and before the internet was even a thing. People shared floppies full of programs the same way they shared mixed tapes full of Cyndi Lauper tracks. And this way of transferring data even had a name, Sneakernet, because you literally have to use your feet to transport digital information from one machine to another and what people put on those shared disks could be anything, software sure, but so much more, especially with all the new digital creation tools that started to spring up.</p>

Soon she made a business from selling her disks through mail order. Then her career as an interface designer took off. Her story is a testament to the floppy and the power of Sneakernet. There was a time when you could run an entire operating system off a single 160-kilobyte floppy drive, but by the mid '90s you needed multiple floppy disks to run anything. Files got bigger and bigger and it was annoying to do the floppy disk shuffle in and out of your machine.</p>

       <p>The writing was on the wall when the 1998 iMac was the first personal computer to ship without a floppy drive. When modems got better and the internet was easier to get on, people moved away from floppies to newer storage technology like the CD ROM and from CDs we moved on to DVDs, SD cards, USB flash drives. Turn around, and there's a whole graveyard of obsolete storage technology behind us. And now we have the cloud. Poor old floppies, they didn't stand a chance. But here's the thing, floppies linger. They have staying power. There's still the save icon for starters.</p>

       <p>People still have shoe boxes full of them. Floppies have in fact proven to be one of the most resilient pieces of technology out there. You might be surprised to learn they're still used to maintain the legacy machines like the US Intercontinental Ballistic Missile System. Up until recently, that system relied on 8-inch floppy drives for real. Matthew Kirschenbaum is a professor of English and Digital Studies at the University of Maryland.</p>

       <p>So there was a story that was making the rounds about the US Air Force phasing out 8-inch floppy disks from its nuclear command and control systems. And so this was accompanied by pictures of people down in the missile silos plugging floppy diskettes into sort of old style mainframe computers. And I think that surprised a lot of people to see that something like nuclear weaponry was still controlled by 8-inch floppy disks. The government, the military is finally phasing those systems out. And I certainly think that's a good thing, but it's worth remembering, too, that floppies tend to be pretty durable and resilient as storage media goes. They're low areal density, meaning that they're relatively coarse or low-fi as compared to hard drives nowadays. Which actually made them a little bit more resilient, and reliable. They were also, because of the very age, the very obsolescence of those computer systems. They were ironically more protected against some of the kinds of networked threats that we see nowadays in the forms of viruses, and hacking, and that sort of thing. The phrase people used was the “air gap,” and so the floppies were not physically connected to the internet in any way and there's a way to think of that as a pretty desirable security feature. Even though it made people a little bit queasy. It's not completely absurd that they've persisted in use for as long as they have.</p>

       <p>Tony understood what the information on these disks were and he was using utilities on a machine to read the disk as if it was back in 1990 and the data was something that made sense to him. We went after the disks that were very obviously standard copies of files. Trying to make sure we weren't touching any one-of-a-kind disks until we knew what we were up against. Some of the things that were on these initial simple disks were things like Death Bounce. A game that he made that never came out along with an Asteroids Clone. They worked, and we were able to make them play on the machine and he was looking at games he hadn't even thought about for decades and they were running fine.</p>

       <p>So to restore those images, you have to have a hard drive volume the same size as the one that you wrote it from. Of course, I brought drives, but what are the odds we're going to have the exact same size because you didn't always. That's okay, I'll make a 10 meg partition on my card here, and I will make a copy of these disks, and I will tell it that you have been backed up from a 10-meg drive. We proceed to restore it and after that get a nice hard drive full of a source code files to go through.</p>
