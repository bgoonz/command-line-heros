                                <p>The computing industry started booming after World War II. General Electric’s CEO refused to enter that market. But a small team of rebel employees bent the rules to forge on in secret. They created the GE 225. It was a giant leap in engineering that pushed computing from a niche market to the mainstream—sowing the seeds for today’s tech industry.</p>

                                <p class="mb-lg-0">Before the creation of general-purpose mainframes, computers were often built to perform a single function. William Ocasio recalls how GE’s first specialized computers, the ERMA, helped banks process thousands of transactions per day. John Joseph recounts how a few key GE employees hoodwinked their CEO into creating a computing department. Tomas Kellner explains how their work resulted in a revolutionary machine: the GE 225. And Joy Lisi Rankin describes how engineers at Dartmouth College adapted the GE 225 for time-sharing and used it to create BASIC—major milestones in making computing more accessible.</p>

        <p>Let's wind the clock back a few decades. Back to the late ‘40s, early ‘50s. There was only one serious name in the computer game: IBM. It's nickname was Snow White. The other much smaller tech companies where the Seven Dwarves. One of those dwarves was General Electric, a company that sometimes built special-order machines, but never produced computers for the open market.</p>

        <p>General purpose computers were IBM's territory, and IBM was GE's second largest customer next to the US government. They were regular buyers of GE's vacuum tubes, motors, transformers and switches, and the president of GE, Ralph Cordiner, wanted to keep it that way. Yet every once in a while, a GE department head would write up a business plan that veered in the direction of the computer business, and when those plans wound their way up to the president's office for final sign off, they would be promptly rejected with a big fat no, and the initials RJC scribbled on the top page—in orange crayon, no less.</p>

        <p>In fact, throughout Cordiner's 13-year reign as president and CEO, GE never swayed from that position. Even as research pointed to computers as the fastest growing segment of the electronics industry, employees with projects that crossed the line faced Cordiner's wrath. And yet, a small group of rebel employees saw an opportunity to build a mainframe computer, and they couldn't let the idea go. Little did they know that this computer would save the banking industry, open the door to timesharing, and give birth to a whole new programming language. Last season, we heard how John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz created BASIC at Dartmouth College, and we learned that BASIC is an interpreted language, which means it was too resource heavy for early computers. It's an example of a great idea that had to wait for the right hardware moment. The GE 225 was that hardware. In this episode, we uncover a little known story of a mainframe-that-almost-wasn't yet this room-sized computer would be a gateway machine, inspiring visionary command line heroes like Steve Wozniak and Bill Gates to launch the personal computing revolution. Its creation is still meaningful today. I'm Saron Yitbarek, and this is Command Line Heroes, an original podcast from Red Hat. Season Four: Hardware.</p>

        <p>In 1947, a check winds its way through a bank to get deposited, and legions of bank workers are clocking in countless hours to deal with all those checks. The post-war economy was booming, but that meant banks were now drowning in paperwork. They were forced to close at 2 PM just to leave time for filling out ledgers by hand, and they were still falling behind. A fast, powerful machine was urgently needed to keep up with the pace of business. Over at Bank of America, they had millions of checks to handle each day.

        <p>So in 1950, B of A contracted Stanford Research Institute (SRI) to figure out how to automate the handling of all those checks. It took SRI 5 years to build a prototype, which they called the electronic recording machine accounting, or ERMA. The machine had over a million feet of wiring, 8,000 vacuum tubes, and weighed about 25 tons. It had the potential to handle 50,000 transactions a day.</p>

        <p>Bank of America was keen to start producing the ERMA right away. So they sent out a request for proposal (RFP) to electronics manufacturers to bid on the job. Of course, everyone figured the winner would be the juggernaut of business machines: Ms. Snow White herself, IBM. Doc Baker was the VP of the Electronics Division over at GE, and he knew his boss, Cordiner, didn't want to move into IBM's territory. He knew computers were out of bounds, but when he got wind of Bank of America's RFP, well, Baker saw an opening he didn't want to miss. He approached Barney Oldfield, the manager of GE's microwave laboratory in Palo Alto, which was the nearest facility to SRI, and he made Oldfield a proposition. Here's John Joseph, an Associate Professor of Strategy at the University of California, Irvine.</p>

Not any of the other technology manufacturers—the underdogs got it. The underdogs at GE won the multimillion dollar contract. On April 9, 1956, B of A's board of directors accepted GE's proposal. Baker signed a $31 million contract without running it by his boss, Cordiner. This impossible project was becoming real. All Oldfield needed now was a place to build the ERMAs.

        <p>The bigger challenge lay in where to locate the manufacturing facility.

John Pivoden was in charge of the hardware. Henry Harold was the logic designer. And Jay Levinthal was the system architect. Holed up in what seemed to them like the middle of nowhere, the team got along surprisingly well. They were up to the task to build the ERMA under a shroud of secrecy, and it didn't hurt that they had a sense of humor about the whole thing. We found an old skit that the team performed, something they called Frontiers of Progress, and I think it shows you where they were at. Here's an excerpt.</p>

        <p>Early in the process, the team decided that the GE version of ERMA would be transistorized. In the '50s, transistors were more expensive than vacuum tubes, but they required less space and simpler connectors to the logic boards. So, each vacuum tube and flip flop would be replaced by two transistors, with some additional resistors and capacitors to hold it all together. The other big change to the original prototype was to make the ERMA a stored program computer rather than a hardwired machine. This would allow for a simpler machine design and easier modifications later on. Since most of GEs developers were on the hardware side, they needed to hire themselves a programmer. They chose a man who not-too-many years before had escaped Nazi Germany and had come to the U.S. as a refugee. His name was Joseph Weizenbaum.</p>

With no experience in banking other than cashing his own checks, Weizenbaum would now lead the micro programming team to write software capable of supporting the transistorized hardware. The team also programmed all the peripheral devices including the checks orders, and something they called the MICR reader. That stands for magnetic ink character recognition. You know that line of numbers on the bottom of your checks? That's MICR. Three sets of numbers that identify a bank account, a routing number and a check number, and it's still there on all your checks because of the work Weizenbaum and his team did out in Phoenix.</p>

The system could only handle 100 transactions a day, but it was a step in the right direction. The next step, get it to process the required 55,000 transactions a day.</p>

A line of computers, the 200 series, with a dual purpose. They would be specific process control machines and a general purpose system. Claire called his business plan, The Big Look. He recruited more engineers to the Phoenix team, including someone who had worked on the GE-312 and 412 process control computers back in New York. His name was Arnold Spielberg, and he would lead the team.</p>

        <p>After looking over the technical specs, Arnold said something like, "Hey, if we move a few things around on this piece of hardware, we could have a highly competitive general purpose machine." Arnold added peripheral devices like card readers, printers, and magnetic tape handlers. The production prototype was completed in just 5 months. The new general purpose machine was called the GE-225. Fun fact, Arnold Spielberg is Steven Spielberg's dad. I spoke to Tomas Kellner, GE's chief storyteller, to learn more about Mr. Spielberg and his role in creating the machine that the brass never wanted, the GE-225.</p>

        <p>One thing that was really interesting was that this computer actually had its own memory, and that was able to record and output information. The memory could store between 8,000 to 16,000 20-bit words, and then it also had an auxiliary memory that had about 32,000 20-bit words. Some of the computers that he also worked on were wire software, so they were really hard to use. They basically had to be programmed once, and that was all you could do. This was different because of the computer's ability to store data.</p>

They wanted to come up with a tool that would allow computer programmers to work from different terminals at the same time. And that tool was essentially, would later became BASIC. Now an interesting aside about BASIC is that GE promptly licensed BASIC from Dartmouth and started using it internally and started offering it with their computers, which is how it got to Steve Wozniak. He was exposed to a terminal that was connected to the GE-225 computer running BASIC, and he was so smitten with it that he actually started writing his first software on that terminal.</p>

        <p>Timesharing, BASIC, and Dartmouth and GEs relationship are crucial to ushering in what I call an era of personal computing before social computers and social networking, well before Facebook. GE was easily able to take what was learned from Dartmouth building this timesharing system and adapt it to their own business and quickly build a global timesharing service industry. I think at one point in 1970 they had 100,000 timesharing users in Europe alone. So this was a substantial business for them through the 1970s into the 1980s.</p>

        <p>In our next episode, we're picking up from where the GE-225 left off to talk about how that mainframe inspired a whole new generation of programmers to kickstart the personal computing revolution and how that generation inspired us today. Command Line Heroes is an original podcast from Red Hat. Head on over to <a href="https://www.redhat.com/commandlineheroes">redhat.com/commandlineheroes</a> for some great research on the team behind the GE-225. I'm Saron Yitbarek. Until next time, keep on coding.</p>
