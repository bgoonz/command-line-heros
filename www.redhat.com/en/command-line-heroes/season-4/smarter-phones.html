                                <p>Few could imagine what a handheld computer would look like—or even do. But a trio of visionaries saw where computing was headed. To succeed in this new frontier, though, they would need to create everything from scratch, and throw out the conventional wisdom on hardware.</p>

                                <p class="mb-lg-0">Their creation, the PalmPilot, went on to break sales records. It showed the world what was possible and it helped people realize that the value in tech was shifting once again. But when the tech bubble burst, and new competitors entered the market, Palm’s grip on the handheld computing industry began to slip.</p>

       <p>In the early 90s, a handy software developer took a stack of wood, and carved it into small blocks of various sizes. He carefully compared the weight of each block. And when he found one that felt pocket-sized, he taped a printout of a tiny monitor onto it. Then he tucked the block in his shirt pocket, and walked around with it, to see how it would feel to be attached to a device. He was imagining, in a not so distant future, where we'd all be doing the same thing. If you think that guy's name was Steve Jobs, you're wrong. His name was Jeff Hawkins, and he co-created the PalmPilot. When the iPhone hit the market in 2007, critics and competitors questioned whether a smartphone would succeed.</p>

       <p>A decade later, the question is, how can a person succeed without one? Smartphones are ubiquitous. Their apps allow us to do pretty much anything. And the hardware running them says a lot about who we are. But as central as the iPhone has been to the rise of our mobile lives, it wasn't the catalyst. This is the epic story of how an earlier handheld device paved the way for the smartphone. And it's the story of a devoted team that stuck with that device for its entire journey. I'm Saron Yitbarek, and this is Command Line Heroes, an original podcast from Red Hat.</p>

       <p>The smartphone concept has been around since Star Trek’s tricorder. In real life though, the concept first translated into cell phones in 1984, bulky things that looked like bricks during the 90s they got a bit smaller, small enough for Zack Morris to carry on Saved by the Bell—but they were still just used for phone calls. Remember phone calls? Nothing “smart” was happening on mobile phones, but there was another piece of technology gaining traction. It was called a PDA, a personal digital assistant, a mobile electronic device that acted as your personal information manager. We'll get to that in a moment, but at the time, the tech industry was way more focused on the personal computer, which we learned about in episode 3 when we looked at the Altair 8800.</p>

       <p>Palm started out developing information management software for a PDA that Casio was making, called the Zoomer. They also made some synchronization software for Hewlett Packard's devices, but those first-gen PDAs weren't taking off. And then the whole personal digital assistant dream looked like a lost cause after the high-profile failure of Apple's efforts. The Newton—they were all too big, too heavy, and the software was too slow. But the Palm team wondered whether a new approach could change the game.</p>

However, what happened along the way was we figured out that industry architecture, if you will, that stacked up didn't make sense for handheld computing. What we learned was the right way to build these was with highly integrated hardware and software products. So, what changed our mind was born out of failure, essentially.</p>

       <p>Jeff was a guy who took a completely contrarian point of view. He said, the problem you're trying to solve is it's too slow. Then the conventional wisdom is to add a faster processor. He took the other approach saying, well, how do you make it faster for the customer? It's not only about the hardware, it's about if you make the software slim and light, then that will succeed and then that will have its own spiraling effect of: that will be small, it'll be lighter, it will have longer battery life. So we developed this philosophy of stripping down the number of steps and being super critical about efficiency.</p>

Designing the Palm OS platform involved new concepts and new ways of thinking that were different from designing for bigger machines. With PCs, the more features the better. But handhelds are a different creature. According to the Zen of Palm, handhelds should be all about the user. Features should be tightly focused and the device should be usable anywhere.</p>

It was to take the nuggets that you really needed at any time and put that on the screen.

An example I like to use is that rather than three-tap—turning on a device, hitting a calendar app, hitting the date for today—this was one of the most common things you wanted to do. What if you could just press one button, and this button would turn on the device, take you to the calendar app, and show you today? It was a “today button.” And now, again, these sorts of things seem obvious, but at the time, this was quite radical. That was not how you interacted with devices. So, that took tremendous coordination between the hardware and the software.</p>

But there was one problem. It was their last $3 million. Palm had an amazing new handheld computing device, and they were flat broke. The Palm team's hail-Mary solution to keep on financing their new product was to sell the company to US Robotics in 1995. It was the only way they could get this new connected organizer, which they dubbed the PalmPilot into the hands of customers. And they knew there'd be customers.

And so, right after they helped their parent company revolutionize the market, Jeff Hawkins, Donna Dubinsky, Ed Colligan, Rob Haitani, and others left Palm to form a new company. They called it Handspring. There, they would license the software they'd created, Palm OS, and load it onto their own handhelds. They had built a giant. And now, they were going to try to take it down, David-and-Goliath style, using its own OS. In 1999, the newly formed Handspring, free from those old parent companies released its own hardware, the Visor line of PDAs. And they ran on Palm OS. Ed Colligan remembers its public reception.</p>

I know all the back and forth is making me a little dizzy, too. The Treo became Palm's powerhouse product and the most popular smartphone on the market. But of course by that point, the Palm OS had started to show its age. New players had entered the market. Companies like RIM with its Blackberry.</p>

       <p>No one had ever seen anything like Web OS, it laid the groundwork for the whole smartphone experience we take for granted today. In fact, iOS and Android gleaned a lot from its features. Features like multiple synchronized calendars, unified social media and contact management, curved displays, wireless charging, integrated text and web messaging, unintrusive notifications. You could upgrade it easily just by putting it into dev mode and you could receive over-the-air updates. Web OS was an amazing achievement that no other company could match. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough.</p>
