                                <p>Steve Wozniak (aka Woz) has had a tremendous effect on the world of hardware. Season 4 features many of the devices he’s designed, built, worked on, and been inspired by. But for Woz, what’s most important isn’t necessarily the devices he’s created—it’s how he built them.</p>

                                <p class="mb-lg-0">Woz recounts how his early tinkering led to a lifelong passion for engineering. He started learning about computers on a GE 225 in high school. Soon enough, he was designing improvements to computers he wanted to buy—eventually defining his mantra for simplicity in design. That philosophy helped him finish the Apple I after seeing the Altair 8800 at the Homebrew Computer Club, and to create the floppy drive for the Apple II. But what he’s proudest of these days is the recognition for his engineering accomplishments—and sharing them with the world.</p>

       <p>Hello, I'm Saron Yitbarek, host of Command Line Heroes, an original podcast from Red Hat. This season, our fourth season, if you're counting, we took you on a historical journey into the world of hardware and the teams who dare to change the rules to make them. From the Eagle minicomputer to the GE-225 mainframe, the Altair 8800 to the floppy disk, the PalmPilot to the Sega Dreamcast, machines that are now obsolete and largely forgotten, but they all paved the way to the hardware of today and how we've evolved as developers.</p>

       <p>If you recall from many of our episodes this season, Steve Wozniak's name came up not once, not twice, but on several occasions. That's because the Woz, as he's affectionately known, not only lived that history, but he was instrumental in it. This very special command line hero sat down with us to talk about his lived experience in the annals of hardware. We started by asking him about the first piece of hardware he ever fell in love with.</p>

       <p>When I was very, very young, maybe 10 years old, I fell in love with a transistor radio, and for years I would sleep with it playing music by the side of my head then. So that was kind of a first one, but there were a lot of other steps in there. There were science fair projects that I did that were just hundreds of .incredible parts. Now, when if you get down to computerish stuff, command line stuff, I somehow discovered when I was 10 years old, a manual that talked about logic, digital logic, and I would play games on paper with it. And I said, "Computers are going to be the love of my life."</p>

       <p>They let me have the manual. They gave it to me. I took it home and I studied it. My gosh, it had all the little registers at what different ones and zeroes mean, what instructions they mean, how the data is stored in memory. Oh, my gosh. So I started sitting down on paper saying, "I wonder if I could design a computer." And that was a big start for me. And I got this brochure. I would order brochures to get the parts. How could you ever get a hold of a computer company? How could you get their address?</p>

And I found the library on the second floor, and I'd sit down, and there were computer journals and magazines, and they had little cards you could order manuals from. So I ordered the Data General manual, and it came kind of showing the big, established names of the president and the head of operations and the head of software and engineering. Wow.

One instruction, and little bits had individual, small meanings. One bit might mean set the carry before the addition. Another bit, three bits might mean do you add, subtract, or exclusive or, and some other operations. And then another bit said, do you complement the result and do you shift the result? And do you shift the carry in? Wait a minute. Each bit had an individual meaning.</p>

I sat down to design it, and every time they had one bit with one meaning, that bit was a wire that ran to the chip that did exactly that thing, and it wound up with about half as many chips as all my other minicomputer designs, and it was just as good. I had posters of that computer on my wall that they shipped with their brochure. One was of it in a rack, like normal computerish stuff, you know, because it was front panel, switches for ones and zeroes, lights for ones and zeroes, all that geeky stuff.</p>

And I decided, I also told my dad, I fell in love with it so much. I told my father, "Someday I'm going to own a 4K Data General Nova computer." Why 4K? You need 4K to run a language like Fortran, which I'd programmed in, or ALGOL or PL/I, any programming language needed 4K. I had never programmed in BASIC, so I told my dad that, and he said it costs as much as a house, and I said, "I'll live in an apartment." I had made up my mind then and there. I was going to have a computer that I could actually use.

       <p>This computer taught me, you should always architect things to use the parts that are available to have the least structure and the fewest parts. That was something I became very good at. I'd been working and working at designs, always trying to get fewer and fewer chips, and if you design it around chips that already exist, you can use much fewer parts and much cleaner, much less work, in a sense, to understand it. And that became my mantra for design. Always seek simple, straightforward, easily understood, and don't complicate it by coming up with something you want to build and then wind up putting 20 chips together to kind of do the right functions and get the right signals on wires. No, look for the simple, direct approach.</p>

       <p>I was showing all these designs of video games like Atari games, and I even designed Breakout for Atari, and I saw the ARPANET. That's the forerunner of today's internet, but it started out with like five or six computers spread all across the country. I saw somebody on that, and I knew how to design anything by then. And to use my TV as output, I had done that for video games. So I sat down and built a little terminal with a keyboard that costs 60 bucks. Way back then, that was the most expensive part of any of these things. I had a keyboard and a video display, and I could, over the phone line, contact the ARPANET and go on with very slow texting for very slow over phone line modems in those days, and I could type to a computer in Boston that could type back to me. And I could switch over to a computer at UCLA, and then I could read files and I could run programs. This was so incredible.</p>

Nobody knows you can use your own TV that you own. I'll go and show off my design and give it away, and I'll be a hero." I went down to the club, and everybody was talking about this thing called the Altair. It had been on the front of Popular Electronics. I didn't know about it. There were people that had gone and visited the company at the club. They were all talking about now you can buy a computer for $400. It was a machine with only 256 bytes of RAM for that price, and it used static RAM. All it was, was an Intel datasheet, Intel microprocessor, with Intel showing you exactly connected this way to these switches and these lights, and then you could have a little system to punch in ones and zeroes.</p>

It was just out of the range of any normal human, so we wouldn't have even considered it was a computer that could do useful things. What's a useful thing?

I said, "Wait a minute." I discovered the price of microprocessors had finally come down. The Intel one was $400. I could not afford that. For a single microprocessor, that's what the Altair was based on: Intel. And then as an HP employee, I could buy a Motorola 6800 for $40. Whoa. So I designed my computer to put a microprocessor and memory. Not expensive static memory that you can't afford, 32 chips worth. Just eight chips of dynamic memory and then five other chips to help cycle it and make it not forget its data. It's called refreshing.</p>

It wasn't like you could type “run checkbook” to run a checkbook program. I wanted to get to that level someday, and we had a staff meeting, and they were going to allow ...

So I took out all the Shugart digital chips, all the ones that would step tracks, track to track to track with what's called stepping motor, had phases, A, B, C, D, and every other phase. A would be a track one, and then you go B-C, and now you're on track two. And you go D-A again, you're on track three.

It would have taken me so many chips, 10 to 20 chips, who knows, with timers in there to determine when is it really making the decision to flip.

       <p>I'll put an address in that's at state. That's where it is now in deciding things, and in comes this one bit that's coming from the read head of the floppy. I'll put that one read bit in, and then the ROM decides here's what my next state will be, and then here comes the bits the next day. And I could flip it—28 of those cycles at seven megahertz equals a four-microsecond stretch, and I could just have it go to stage one, stage two, stage three, stage 28, and then eventually around stage 40 or something, it makes a decision. Did I get a pulse or not? I'll shift a zero or I'll shift a one into the register that goes to the computer.</p>

       <p>This whole thing was two chips just to read all that data. I look back, I do not know where the magic was pouring out of my head in those days. I just looked at what's the problem, what is the absolute minimum number of parts to do that job and not how it's ever ... because I'd never known how it was done before. I had a high school programmer, Randy Wigginton, working on this with me all those days too. When I got all done, I said, "Why are the other boards so big that they sell for Altair and the S-100 computers?"</p>

       <p>And I pulled out, I think it was a North Star eight-inch floppy disk or something. I looked at their board, and it had like 50 chips on it. I only had eight on mine, and I could handle two floppy drives. And it worked. We introduced it at the show. I got to see Las Vegas, I got to teach my high school friend Randy how to play craps, and he won 35 bucks, and that was a big, important difference. To be able to run a program is a huge step for a user.</p>

       <p>Well, I believe in it. And you should always make things and share what you have and make it possible for others to use their own skills and experience and expand on it and do something new and more than you had even thought of originally and apply it to a lot of different applications in the world. Not just one tiny one that you understand. No, I'm totally for that. And a lot of the embedded processors now, these tiny little processors, here's a guy who actually built a business card, as thin as a business card with a little flat chip on it, you know barely, and it plugs into USB. For $2 he builds it, and it's a full Linux computer.</p>

The Raspberry Pi is the computer, and the kit is just all the lights and switches for the old PDP-8 minicomputer, and it can run some PDP-8 programs from back then. Only has 4K of memory maximum, and it's how do you connect it to something. The processor is now software inside of a Raspberry Pi. And now you can connect Raspberry Pi to sensors and output devices, and people will want to experiment and explore.</p>

       <p>Going back to building some of the retro computers sure teaches you how hardware connects to hardware and how to hook it up and how to do more things with it. What can I do that hasn't been done yet? A little bit differently maybe. That's what I love. The independent person, usually a student. I want to learn, I want to try something. It doesn't have any value in life. I look back to a series of projects, maybe 10 or 15 projects where they didn't have any value. They were just fun things I thought of at the time: "Maybe I can do this. I'll try putting this together. I'll build this up." If you know how a chip is constructed inside, you could figure out how the whole circuit is going to work.</p>
