        <p>Hi, everyone. We're back. We're excited to launch season three of Command Line Heroes. We have so many of you to thank for the stories featured on this show because each and every season begins with us talking to developers, SIS admins, IT architects, engineers, and folks in the open source community about the topics and technologies you're most interested in. Now, we're opening up this approach even more. We want all of you to weigh in and help shape the future of Command Line Heroes. You could do this by taking our short survey. What do you like about the show? What would you like us to talk about more? Dear listener, we want to know more about you. Are you a developer? Do you work in operations, or do you do something completely separate from the world of tech? Go to commandlineheroes.com/survey to help us level up the podcast for season four and beyond. Now, onto season three.</p>

On one side of the battlefield, Netscape, which had formed an alliance with Sun Microsystems. On the other, you've got Microsoft, software behemoth. And what were the spoils they were fighting over? It was a battle to decide who would be the gatekeeper of the internet. The stakes could not be larger.</p>

        <p>Clive and I got talking about the browser wars, but let me really set the scene for you. You've got Netscape realizing that the browser was this key piece of software that people were going to use to get online. And then you've got Microsoft, their whole business model was packaging stuff inside Windows. They hadn't really been interested in browsers until in the 1990s, Microsoft realized that maybe they'd been sleeping at the wheel. The world was moving online, and there was nothing inside of Microsoft Windows that would help them get there. But these guys over here, some company called Netscape, they're offering an on-ramp to the internet. All of a sudden, Microsoft's industry wide dominance doesn't look so absolute. The browser wars begin in that moment, the moment when Microsoft wakes up to the power of the internet and squints its eye at their new competition. So, that's my setup. Here's me and Clive hashing out what happened next.</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-12">
        <p>The fight was over who was going to be the main portal to going online. You have to realize that in the early '90s, no one was really online very much. And when Mosaic came along and eventually turned into Netscape, they were the first browser that anyone could download that will let you look at the web. They went online in December of 1994. So, suddenly, you know thousands and millions of people are able to use the internet in this kind of graphical way. They're just getting massive, massive downloads and huge amounts of press. Everyone's basically saying, "Yeah, Netscape is kind of the future of this thing called the internet."</p>

        <p>So over in Seattle, you've got Microsoft watching this with enormous alarm because they had pretty much ignored the internet. They were focused on selling Windows, and they had really not paid any attention to this crazy newfangled thing called the internet. So they had to play a very rapid game of catch up. They did not get their own browser out for almost a year later. In the fall of 1995, their browser came out, and that was essentially the beginning of the browser wars, the moment when Microsoft was trying to fight to be the portal by which people went online.</p>

        <p>No, it's true. It doesn't sound like a long time, but things were moving so rapidly back then. And there was a strong sense of first mover advantage, that the first company that could sort of brand themselves as the way you get online would be the winner for years and years and maybe forever. I remember how rapid the pace of development was. I mean, Netscape was putting out a new browser every couple of months, right? They would be, "Wow. Now, we've got email integrated into the browser. Now, we've got a sort of a little search bar up top." It just kept on becoming better and better. You could sort of see you know all the things you could do online swimming into view as they've rapidly iterated and rapidly pushed things out.</p>

        <p>That, my friend, was the billion dollar question. So around the time Netscape saw that Microsoft was competing with them, they took a look at Java™. Was Java going to be the language for web development? Java was this rich compiled language. It performed just as well as C++. But it did still need to be compiled. Developers really wanted something more lightweight, something that could be interpreted instead of compiled, something that would appeal to all those non-professional programmers that were swarming to the web. Those new programmers wanted to work directly on the webpage after all. That was the dream.</p>

Wouldn't it be great, they thought, if they could release a new lightweight language that worked wonders for web programming, at the same time that they released Netscape 2.0 in beta. There was only one hitch. That gave them exactly 10 days to create a new language. Actually, it gave one guy, Brendan Eich, 10 days. He was the one tasked with pulling this off. There was no doubt that if anybody could do it, this guy could. When Brendan was a student at the University of Illinois, he used to create new languages for fun, just to play around with syntax.</p>
