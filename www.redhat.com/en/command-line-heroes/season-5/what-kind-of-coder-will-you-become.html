                                <p>The 10X Coder is often positioned as a mythical developer who can always save the day. Saron and Clive investigate how much of that myth is grounded in truth. </p>

                                <p class="mb-lg-0">Greg Sadetsky argues that coding is much like professional sports&mdash;some athletes are bound to be much better than those starting out. Brianna Wu and Bonnie Eisenman pick apart the myth by sharing how much they have had to clean up after supposed 10X Coders. Jonathan Solórzano-Hamilton recounts the story of Rick, a self-proclaimed rockstar developer who assumed too much. And everyone considers the benefits of the 1X Coders&mdash;because what use is code without ideas and experiences to guide development?

        <p>Hello, welcome to Command Line Heroes, an original podcast from Red Hat. This is the final episode of our special mini-season all about our jobs as developers, sys admins, architects, engineers, and programmers. In this episode, we're going to talk about the issues surrounding the question: “What kind of coder will you become?” I'm your host Saron Yitbarek, and joining me is our featured guest, Clive Thompson. He's a journalist, technology writer, and author of the book Coders. Hi Clive.</p>

        <p>Thanks for joining us, Clive. Last summer, Twitter was buzzing about a particular topic, a particular type of coder. It started with a tweet from an investor, and it quickly went viral. In short, it encouraged founders to hire a rare breed of coder as soon as possible to increase their startup’s chances of success. These coders have a special designation: “10X.” The response to the tweet was...not great. Here's just a taste:</p>

        <p>When someone says “10X coder,” there's either one of two things going on. The first possibility is that they mean it as a euphemism for brilliant ***hole.

        <p>Well, as the name suggests, it's a coder who is 10 times better, more productive, more creative, however you want to measure that. They are 10 times better than the average coder sitting alongside them, right? They're this sort of super person who can execute things faster, write better code, more code, ship it more quickly, have better ideas, just like, essentially, a sort of super-powered creature&mdash;that is the theory behind the 10X coder.</p>

        <p>The whole idea of a 10X coder has never really made sense to me, because it's such a specific number, 10X. You are 10 times better than the average coder. How could you possibly measure that? How would you even know if anyone is 5 times, 10, 100 times better than the average coder? What does that even mean?</p>

        <p>Well, it's funny that there's this number attached because it sort of cracks me up. Every field has this idea that there's someone who is just way better than others. They have that idea in music and entertainment, they're sort of the star, they have that in every discipline, but in coding they put a number on it. It's data-driven, and they love to quantify things. But in this case, there's actually kind of a history behind that number, there's a reason why it's 10. It actually goes back to the 1960s. In the early days of coding, no one was really sure what it meant to do this for a living, and no one was really sure what productivity kind of looked like. They had some sense that some people seemed to be better at it than others, and they couldn't really figure out why.</p>

        <p>And so this one guy, Hal Sackman, decided to do a study where he was trying to answer a question: “Do coders prefer to work in an online system or an offline?” And what online and offline meant back then was, offline meant kind of working where you wrote your code on punch cards, and then handed it to a punch card operator, and they fed it in, and then three hours later, you found out whether or not your code worked, right? Online meant you could sit in front of a screen and a keyboard, and you could type, and you could execute your code right away, a more modern way of coding, that's the way we code today. But online coding was really expensive, because those computers were really expensive. Are people so much more productive that it's worth spending the money on these expensive online computers?</p>

        <p>So Hal Sackman said: "Okay, I'm going to give a bunch of coders the same task in online versus offline, and I'm going to see how well they do." But he discovered something so remarkable to him that he sort of focused on it. The people who were doing this test, there was a subset of them that were way better than everyone else. Like, the delta between the really good and the really bad is massive. Sometimes people were 20 times faster at solving a bug than other people. Sometimes they were 16 times faster at writing a piece of code. It's kind of like there's this order of magnitude difference between the really great performers and the really bad ones and that was the beginning of the 10X mythology that people who are really good at coding are rare, and they are 10 times better than everyone else. From there on, the myth sort of grew until it is what we have today.</p>

        <p>A pro player in whatever sports is undeniably extremely much better than average, you know, somebody who plays sports or who is just starting out. So as in other fields, it's the same in software engineering, and I definitely can vouch for the fact that they exist. If you have a startup, and you know that you need to be on the market in a month, the supply of people that can do the work in that amount of time, and bring you where you want to be, is smaller than the supply of people who can do the same work in three months or a year.

        <p>Well, in that book, Fred Brooks was thinking about the art of managing software projects. There was this paradox in software development whereby if a project had, like, 20 people working on it, and it was really late in any other industry, like, say you're building a building or digging a ditch or building a fence, the way you move faster is you hire more people so that more hands can just get that done faster. But in software, often the opposite happened. If you had 20 people working on the project, and it was late, and you added 10 more people, the project slowed down. Why is that? Well, part of it is that there is a lot of communication that's involved in software projects, and so the more people you add, the more communication there is and you sort of get bogged down in organization.</p>

        <p>But he also reiterated this idea that there was a handful of people that were just better at this than everyone else. And so he's, like, "Look, if you had like a huge team of 200 people and 25 of them are doing most of the work, then just get rid of the other 175 and just have your 25 superstars and everything's going to happen faster." It, sort of, so flattered the fantasy that a lot of software developers have that they are the 10X person, right? That they are the sort of Colossus who bestrides the world like a giant with all these ants scurrying between their legs. It definitely is a lesson that a lot of people quote from, and every time someone came along, this mythology just got more and more cemented in place.</p>

        <p>Well, from a venture capitalist point of view, what are they doing? They are trying to find a small new company that they think is going to produce a product that is just going to become absolutely massive, and they also want it to move incredibly quickly so it beats everyone else. First to market dominates. So that tends to gravitate towards wanting a team that is very small so that it can iterate quickly, and also a team that can sort of do everything, you know, soup to nuts—the whole stack. When I was talking to Marc Andreessen who really believes in 10X, he says it might even be a 1000X, right? He says: "Look at these really big pioneering pieces of software that changed the arc of the entire industry. You know, Photoshop, Doom and Quake, the original video games, the original Netscape team, Microsoft BASIC."</p>

        <p>Very often you're talking about two to, like, three or four people. And he goes: "That's because there's a type of magic that those highly productive people can do when everyone else just gets out of the way, and they can build that crystal palace in their mind." So that's why venture capitalists really love it, because there's a reality, and there's also a great myth that makes for a really good story, too, because they have to take this dog-and-pony show and sell it to other investors. It's really mythologically and narratively great to be able to say, "Here is the brilliant software king who did all this. Here is Max Levchin who single-handedly coded PayPal into existence,” which he really did; he actually created that prototype. He had spent years and years banging away on mobile software and crypto and payment software, and so he just willed that into existence by himself, the first prototype. So the stories really do exist, but they're enormously marketable and mythic for a venture capitalist.</p>

        <p>And so we started to take a little bit more of an assertive approach of what if instead, we task them with being sort of the first point of contact and being the owners for different parts of the code base that he currently is the sole owner of. And then the request for changes, or bug fixes, or whatnot would have to go through them first, and then they could escalate to him as needed, but that didn't succeed either. When another developer released a fix to a part of the code that had been broken and causing major problems, he went into the code base and actually reverted that fix because he was pretty angry they had the audacity to touch a part of the code base that hadn't been officially given to them. The real tipping point was the crushing morale problem that his presence made on the rest of the team. The more we tried to get them involved in helping him, the more belligerent and intransigent he became, and it was really a vicious cycle.</p>

        <p>If you have someone who really is genuinely talented in that Max Levchin like way, where they're really good, they've done their 10,000 hours and more, they think deeply about the stack. There's two things you want to do, you want to keep them in check, and you want to maybe also take advantage of what they're great at and make that really fantastic for the rest of the company. Some of that is just good management, it's not tolerating ***hole behavior in your company. Setting that standard up high, and making sure that it applies to everyone, even the 10Xers. The second thing is making sure that they don't get locked in a box where they're just producing stuff and no one else knows what's going on. So code review, pair programming, all that stuff.</p>

        <p>Now the other side of the equation, which is like, okay, if you've got someone who's really productive, can you maximize what's good about them? In the smartest companies, what they look for is not just someone who's 10X in their technical capability, but 10X in their social capability, which is to say they are not just great at writing their own code, but they're great at helping everyone else write the best code, too. And these are, like, what you could really call the real 10Xers, the people who are masterful in writing code and thinking about the stack and are masterful at helping junior developers develop, at unblocking other people, and very often I heard stories from companies that they had someone who was just absolutely fantastic in that way.</p>

        <p>Under Rick's regime, anytime somebody would speak up and say, "Hey, I think we could solve it this way," the feedback was biting and cruel and swift, that they really shouldn't even bother speaking up at all. It took a little time for people to come out of their shells a bit, and realize that it was actually safe to start talking about solving the problems collaboratively again. But the team started having big planning meetings, and multiple days of just bantering and sharing ideas and putting things up on the whiteboard and taking them down, and that willingness to be open and communicate and share one's ideas was probably the biggest factor in kind of turning it around. Then people started to feel more comfortable, more healthily confronting each other with different ideas or opinions, or being able to hash things out in a constructive and positive way, with the understanding that respect for each other underlaid every disagreement.</p>

But I think if you wanted to be more clear, people who told me proudly that I'm not a 10Xer I'm a 1Xer, I think their attributes are often that they're the person that is actually the sort of careful, thoughtful developer, who instead of just thinking they can sort of accomplish this all in one sudden romantic evening of bashing out a prototype, is, like, "No, no, I want this thing to work and to scale and to be reliable. I want my code to be readable by other people because they know that coding is a team sport." And so they are working much more patiently and carefully.

        <p>So one guy I talked to, Dennis Crowley, he's a friend of mine, and he created, back in the early aughts, Dodgeball. And he essentially created the idea of the check-in. It was a little service that lets you say, "Hey, I'm at this bar, I'm at this restaurant." And he is, as he told me, the worst coder he has ever met in his entire life. He could not get anything to compile. And he kept on trying to learn and failing and trying to learn and failing, and he was at companies and they would try and teach him and they would give up on it. So finally, he wanted to make this crazy check-in service, he had the idea in his head because he was a nightlife guy from New York. He loved going from bar to bar and he loved the idea.</p>

        <p>What if everyone could communicate where they were at? Like wouldn't that just be fun? And so because he had that idea, he was willing to force himself to make some crappy prototype, and he did it. He basically learned how to program server stuff in ASP. It's just a hairball of code, like, he's shown it to people and they just laughed at him. But he got it working and it turned into not just a company, it turned into an entirely new activity. That's something we all do all the time now. He created that idea, he's a terrible coder by his own admission, but if you have a really great idea, and you're a proud 1Xer, you can tilt the axis of the universe just as much, and maybe even more, than the 10Xers.</p>

        <p>I would say I am hesitantly optimistic that, yes, we are. And I think it's for a couple of reasons: one is that there's been enough attention paid to the toxic side effects of tolerating abuse of creative ***holes. In one respect, one of the greatest things that Susan Fowler, who was that fantastic microservices engineer hired at Uber, and she was hired and she discovered that it was just a complete nightmare of an environment, where all these abusive guys up top were tolerated while they engaged in terrible behavior, including flat out sexual harassment, and she wrote a big blog post about it, and it single-handedly created the shockwave throughout the tech industry saying, "Wow, this stuff is happening, and it's unignorable, and it's driving talent out of companies."</p>
