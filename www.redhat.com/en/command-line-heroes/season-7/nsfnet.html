                                <p>1995 was the year that ISPs became the dominant gateway to the information superhighway. But how’d we go from ARPANET all the way to that? It turns out, none of it would have happened without a team of intrepid engineers at the University of Michigan.</p>

                                <p class="mb-lg-0">Marc Weber tells us how a tension between academics and the military set the next evolution of the ARPANET. Douglas Van Houweling discusses the work his MERIT team did at the University of Michigan to build the national backbone of the NSFNET. Elise Gerich, MERIT’s systems manager, talks about how they made the leap from a T1 connection to a T3 to handle traffic from their growing network. And Janet Abbate emphasizes how all this set the stage for the commercialized internet that birthed the dot-com boom in 1995.</p>

        <p>It didn't sound like much, did it? But as those switches were thrown and a bank of servers grew cold, a part of America was remade. You've maybe heard of the ARPANET, sort of the godfather of the internet, right? An early set of connections between a few military sites and universities. And I know you're familiar with today's internet, but there's a missing link between those two points, another network that thrived for a while in the 80s and 90s. This missing link connects the early days of publicly funded innovation and the later days of commercialized networks. It was called the NSFNET, the National Science Foundation Network, and it served as the internet's backbone for years. The little known story of its origin, and eventual demise in 1995, reveals a lot about how we got the online life we have today. It's the story of how the internet was privatized.</p>

And no moment in 1995 tells you more about that massive change than April 30th, when the Internet's backbone, the NSFNET, was switched off.

        <p>The story of that fateful moment begins, though, back in the early 1980s. The United States was falling behind other countries in the field of large-scale computing, and the National Science Foundation, the NSF, decided to remedy that by creating supercomputing centers all around the states. Only problem was scientists needed access to those supercomputers. The logical thing to do was simply ring up the Defense Department and ask them to upgrade the network that already existed, the ARPANET. And that's exactly what the NSF did. They made a deal, paid the Defense Department $2 million for their trouble and waited. And what the NSF might not have considered was that the Defense Department wasn't so excited about funneling more traffic to the ARPANET. Here's Marc Weber, the curatorial director of the Internet History Program at the Computer History Museum.

        <p>Try and look at this from the perspective of the Defense Communication Agency. Sure, it's nice that all these academics get to share information across the ARPANET, but that made state secrets vulnerable in the process. They grew anxious about the security of the network. Back then in 1983, there was a sci-fi movie called War Games. A teenage Matthew Broderick finds a back door into the U.S. Military's computer system, and thinking he's playing a video game, he almost starts World War III. Sure, that sounds far-fetched, but that movie reflected real concerns. The military in the 1980s was growing frustrated that the ARPANET was open to outsiders.</p>

        <p>In fact, they planned to build a network all their own. In 1985, the NSFNET was born. Independent of the military, the National Science Foundation could provide academics with email, with file transfer protocols so they can upload and download files, and even remote access to time-sharing systems. So they were offering a lot of what the ARPANET had offered. But no, that's not the end of the story. The NSFNET had its heart in the right place, and its protocols in the right place too, but it was built on a deck microcomputer that could manage only 56 kilobits per second, otherwise known as dial-up speed. Downloading a movie at that speed would take about 213 hours.</p>

        <p>They were quickly bogged down, so the NSF put out a request for proposals. Who would like to upgrade their original 1980s network? Who had the vision to deliver phase two of the NSFNET? They received many submissions, but Van Houweling and a team called MERIT from the University of Michigan had spent 6 weeks stitching together an ambitious proposal that stood far above the rest. And this wasn't just the work of academics. Van Houweling and MERIT teamed up with the state of Michigan, with IBM, and with MCI. The MERIT team had supercharged their game by bringing huge corporate players to the table. Van Houweling heard in advance that their proposal had been selected. On the eve of the official announcement, he celebrated with his team, equal parts elated and daunted. It would be their task to save the nation's handful of fledgling regional networks, which were all tied to the overworked NSFNET. They had to make viable what pioneers had been struggling for decades to build. The work ahead seemed enormous.

        <p>Changing the world in this case meant changing the relationship between the National Science Foundation and big tech, a relationship that until then had some rough spots. When word got out in the late 80s that the NSF wanted to build a faster network, AT&T sent over a team of executives to try and dissuade them. AT&T was claiming that, first of all, the NSFNET would never work. And second of all, if anybody should be building a new network, it should be them. Van Houweling and his team wanted to move beyond the dichotomy of private or public. They wanted private and public.</p>

Now at that time, as hard as it is to believe today, there were no commercial internet routers. The consequence of that was that IBM, essentially from whole cloth, built the routers for NSFNET phase 2, and they contributed all that technology to the project.</p>

        <p>Suddenly that little network from NSF had some pretty major players on its team, inspired by commercial interests of their own. Together they really might change the world, but several innovations would be necessary first. As Van Houweling mentioned, there weren't any commercial routers. IBM had to design them based on their own scientific workstations. A half dozen workstations were assembled and new software was written to handle all the routing. IBM had invented a new way to handle the flow of data, a multiprocessor router. And then what about those one-and-a-half megabit communication lines? T1 lines, as they were called, were used by telephone companies, but using them for the NSFNET's purposes caused big patterns to shut down. So MCI had to rebuild the hardware and software.</p>

        <p>Gerich remembers that, despite the big leap to a T1 backbone in 1988, growth on the network was leaping too. Across those 13 regional networks, there were at first 170 smaller networks reliant on the T1 backbone. But only a year later, traffic had grown by 500%. So even turning a 56-kilobit network into a 1.5-megabit network wasn't going to match that new demand. In fact, Gerich, Van Houweling and the whole MERIT team were starting to encounter a kind of paradox. The better you make the network, the more people use the network. They were building a positive feedback loop. In case you're keeping track, there was no worldwide web at this point. We're still in the late 1980s, and yet even the simple applications of FTP and email were enough to drive exponential traffic. Soon they needed to upgrade the network again.</p>

They had scaled the U.S. internet into something that had the true ability to go global. International traffic could transit their network and grow, which means the inevitable finally happened.</p>

        <p>All of these are coming together in this chaotic way, where NSF is from one direction getting Congress saying, you need to build this network, and from another direction, you got the ISP saying, we want to provide commercial service. And then there's people who want to be on the web. And so, I think NSF in a sense just wanted to toss that football to someone else at a certain point and say, we don't want this to be our problem anymore.

        <p>As they finally edged toward that pivotal moment of 1995, an escape plan began to form. The emerging internet had grown beyond the purview of the NSF. They had proven that TCP/IP could thrive without a central manager, and those ISPs were quickly outstripping the NSF's capacity. A hand-off to the private sector seemed the best way to ensure the network could continue to scale. That earlier vision of a noncommercial, publicly funded internet was coming to a close, but that didn't mean a handoff to the private sector would be smooth sailing. Elise Gerich remembers the chaotic months leading up to the 1995 shutdown.</p>

        <p>On the NSFNET's very last day, a dozen staff gathered at the University of Michigan to finally shut it down forever. One by one, they shut off the ENSS's, the exterior nodal switching subsystems. And that evening, the NSFNET breathed its final breath. For some, that day in 1995 came to be known as Internet Independence Day, the day the internet truly left the government's domain. It launched a new age of e-commerce and social media, a whole new landscape of online experience. But the internet's history is never quite that simple. As Janet Abbate notes, the innovations that the academic world brings to our network world did not stop that day.</p>

        <p>Well, in a way I'm not sure what we have today is any more sustainable than the NSFNET was in 1995. We have conflicts we don't exactly know how to resolve. And we didn't cure the problem in 1995 by throwing it to the private sector. I think there was this hope that the private sector is kind of a universal solvent and everything will be fixed by it, and that didn't really happen. So I think we have to face up to the fact that there's always going to be conflicts on the internet, and simply hoping people will exercise self-restraint is not really a substitute for real policy mechanisms.</p>

        <p>I think what a lot of people don't understand is that the internet today stemmed from the need of the research community, first in the United States, and then all over the world, to be able to do their science. The NSFNET was built to support researchers across the nation in working with one another, in accessing the supercomputers, in accessing data that they needed to do their research. So as hard as it may be to realize today, the motivation for NSFNET and the motivation for the first large-scale generation of the internet had nothing to do with making any money. It was absolutely about advancing knowledge and supporting the research community.</p>

        <p>However the internet evolves from here, it's most exciting advances won't just come from some new startup.

That was the marriage of public and private that had pushed the NSFNET to a point of such fantastic possibilities by 1995. For a brief moment in between the ARPANET and today's internet, the NSFNET shined a light on what's possible when government, academics, corporations, all the players, start playing on one team.</p>

                      <p class="text-black">Episode two is all about the ways we share information. Prior to 1995 large amounts of data were shared among universities through traditional methods. Shipping was a very common way to get stacks of documents from one place to another and mailboxes served an integral role in the process. With the advent of the early internet these documents could be digitized to mere bites and sent electronically through an array of connected phone networks. Suddenly the phone jack in the wall could largely replace the trusty old mailbox. The key art we created for this episode aims to illustrate the (at the time) new relationship between the mailbox and the phone jack.
