                    When Chris Nicholson moved to San Francisco, he did what a
                    lot of aspiring tech workers do: He moved into a hacker
                    hostel.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    It wasn't exactly the home he'd hoped for, especially in his
                    late 30s. But it was exactly where he wanted to be.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Chris had spent the better part of a decade as a journalist
                    in Paris. He reported on business for The New York Times and
                    Bloomberg. He had good friends in the city. He even lived in
                    the same building where, in the early 1970s, Bernardo
                    Bertolucci filmed "Last Tango in Paris." It was this small,
                    circular apartment overlooking the Seine. He could look out
                    the window and see the Eiffel Tower.
                  </p>

                  <p>Chris had a good life in Paris. Except one thing.</p>

                    This was a realization that would upend Chris' life.
                    Because, for him, getting on the right side of the robots
                    meant leaving journalism. It meant getting out of Paris and
                    moving to San Francisco. It meant learning to write computer
                    code and starting a new life.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Turns out, being on the right side of the robots also meant
                    sleeping in an old sex toy warehouse for a year.

                  <p>
                    If you spend enough time in Silicon Valley, you'll find a
                    lot of people like Chris, people who are "crammed into cheap
                    bunks, dreaming of future glory," as the title of a 2012 New
                    York Times article once described the phenomenon. For years,
                    they've been flocking to the area, hoping to start a new
                    life in the tech industry. And the housing market can't keep
                    up.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    "Humans move faster than real estate," Chris says. "So
                    warehouses are turned into living spaces and you end up
                    paying around $1,000 for the lower bunk in a room full of
                    snoring guys."
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The hacker hostel Chris moved into? It used to be a
                    warehouse for a company called Good Vibrations.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Sure, it wasn't ideal. But the high density of tech workers
                    at the hacker hostel&mdash;some of whom would go on to work
                    for big tech companies like YouTube, or form their own
                    startups&mdash;meant that there was a built-in community.
                    More than being just a place to sleep, it was a place to
                    meet new people, exchange ideas, and maybe even start a
                    company together.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    This is exactly what Chris wanted. In his late 30s and with
                    virtually no tech experience, he had a lot of catching up to
                    do.

                  <p>
                    So, month after month, Chris went to his day job and, in the
                    evening, he'd return to the hacker hostel and work some
                    more. While many others were playing guitar and watching
                    movies and drinking (yes, it was a lot like a college dorm),
                    Chris was reading everything he could about starting a
                    company.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    And that's how Chris noticed Adam Gibson, a quiet guy with
                    glasses who had a wry sensibility, and who happened to bunk
                    in the room next to Chris.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Adam was working on a Java-based deep learning library and,
                    like Chris, he'd often work late into the night.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    So they started hanging out. They went out to dinner
                    together. They talked about AI and they traded ideas. They
                    even began talking about starting a company together.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    They were a formidable pair. Adam would be the builder.
                    Chris would be the seller. And, together, they would spend
                    the next few years creating an open source deep learning
                    company called Skymind. They'd help companies get into
                    AI&mdash;and, in the process, quietly change how you and I
                    experience the world.

                      If you ask Chris about the name Skymind, he'll let out a
                      big, hearty laugh. It's one of those laughs that, even if
                      he never says it out loud, lets you know that he gets this
                      question all the time&mdash;and has no idea how to answer
                      it.

                    <p>
                      It's true: if you catalog machine learning companies out
                      in the wild, like some sort of tech-industry taxonomist,
                      Chris' system holds up… mostly. There's Google's DeepMind.
                      There's MetaMind, which was bought by Salesforce. There
                      are a bunch of them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      "We were part of that mind wave," Chris says, "when
                      companies were starting to realize that machine learning
                      had business applications."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In the summer of 2013, the same year that Chris and Adam
                      met at the hacker hostel, Google hired a guy named
                      Geoffrey Hinton. At the time, Hinton was a professor at
                      the University of Toronto and had, for years, been making
                      important progress with artificial neural networks,
                      mathematical functions that are modeled after the huge
                      network of neurons in the human brain.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Hinton knew that everything the brain does is an
                      impressive feat, even when it comes to the most mundane
                      tasks. Think about how the brain can isolate a whisper,
                      even in a crowded room. Or recognize a face in a sea of
                      people. Or pick up on the subtleties of humor when talking
                      to a co-worker. According to Hinton, though, the brain's
                      most impressive feat is how it learns&mdash;without
                      explicit instructions.

                      Hinton's big breakthrough was getting computer hardware
                      and software to mimic the brain's learning process,
                      something that AI researchers had been trying to do for a
                      long time. This is why he's often credited with creating
                      the "Big Bang" of machine learning.

                      Using artificial neural networks, machines could sift
                      through huge amounts of data and recognize patterns.
                      Instead of just acting on explicit instructions, machines
                      could learn on their own&mdash;much like the human brain
                      learns. This meant that machines were getting
                      significantly better at understanding speech, recognizing
                      objects, and other seemingly mundane tasks humans perform
                      instinctively.

                    <p>
                      The interesting thing about Hinton was that Google didn't
                      hire him to work at Google X, the company's "moonshot
                      factory," as they describe it. Rather, they hired him to
                      improve some of their core products by making sense of the
                      huge amounts of data Google is always collecting. With
                      Hinton on board, features like Android's voice search
                      could get a lot more reliable.

                      Shortly after Google hired Hinton, another big event
                      happened. Facebook hired Yann LeCun.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      LeCun is most famous for his work with convolutional
                      neural networks&mdash;a type of neural net that's modelled
                      on the visual cortex. It's not hyperbole to say that all
                      of the machine vision work that's making headlines today
                      is the result of LeCun's work. Wherever you see a machine
                      vision application&mdash;self-driving cars, dating apps,
                      or anything else&mdash;it's probably using an algorithm
                      LeCun touched.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Again, LeCun's work at Facebook would influence some of
                      the core features of their product, like facial
                      recognition.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      So Google hired Hinton and Facebook hired LeCun, two
                      enormous hires in a very short time. And other big
                      companies like Baidu and Microsoft were starting to get
                      into the game as well.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      These hires signalled to the rest of the world that
                      machine learning was leaving the university lab and making
                      its way into the industry. In other words, machine
                      learning had business applications.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Suddenly, companies big and small were starting to wake up
                      and ask themselves, "Could machine learning help
                      <em>me</em>?" Like Chris, companies began to realize they
                      were on the wrong side of the robots.

                      Like a lot of Silicon Valley talent, Adam Gibson dropped
                      out of college. For a while, though, he was at Michigan
                      Tech. He spent three years in the upper peninsula studying
                      computer science and business.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Michigan Tech is a Java shop. If you're studying computer
                      science there, you're learning to code in Java, a
                      programming language invented in the early 1990s. So when
                      Adam dropped out of college, moved out west, and
                      eventually set his suitcase down in the room next to
                      Chris' at the hacker hostel, he took the programming
                      language with him.

                      In late 2013, Adam noticed that there weren't any deep
                      learning tools that worked well in Java. In fact, the last
                      time anyone had made a neural net library in Java was in
                      the 1990s, around the last big AI wave.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      A lot had changed since then. Graphics processing units
                      (GPUs) had come on board. Distributed computing had become
                      a reality. Researchers had made significant advances in
                      the algorithms used for deep learning. The whole
                      technology landscape had changed and the old Java
                      libraries didn't account for any of it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This presented a problem to any company looking to follow
                      Google and Facebook into deep learning. Because, in many
                      ways, Java is the dominant language of corporate IT. If a
                      deep learning library doesn't work in Java, it won't work
                      in corporate America.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Without the resources of big tech giants like Google and
                      Facebook, most companies couldn't hire teams of AI experts
                      to build these libraries for them.

                    <p>
                      Adam and Chris wanted to be right there waiting for them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      So Adam started building a deep learning library for Java.
                      He coded late into the night at the hacker hostel while
                      almost everyone else was sleeping&mdash;everyone, that is,
                      except Chris.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Adam spent 2014 writing more and more code while Chris
                      learned more and more about starting a company. All the
                      while, they were working day jobs. Chris was doing PR for
                      FutureAdvisor and Adam was teaching at a data science
                      academy. The money they earned from these jobs was funding
                      their new startup.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      It wasn't exactly a sustainable solution. If their company
                      was going to grow, they needed more money.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      So Chris did what a lot of people do in this situation: He
                      started meeting with investors during his lunch hour.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      "Asking people to shower you with money isn't an easy
                      proposition," Chris says. "It takes a long time to
                      convince them." And it didn't help that, at least in the
                      beginning, Chris didn't know how to pitch the company.
                      There were a lot of questions he didn't have answers for.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Sure, he could talk about the technology Adam was building
                      and why businesses were hungry for deep learning
                      solutions. Chris' background in journalism helped him
                      communicate complex technical subjects clearly.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      But the business model? That took a little more
                      explaining.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Chris and Adam had decided to build an open source
                      company. It wasn't a typical business model. And investors
                      wanted to know how the company was going to make money.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Chris' pitch got a little better each time he gave it.

                    <p>
                      That started to change in late 2014, after Wired ran an
                      article on Skymind. The piece featured Adam talking about
                      how he wanted to "give people machine learning without
                      hiring a data scientist." In other words, they wanted to
                      "give Google's AI to the rest of the world," as the title
                      of the article phrased it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      After the article was published, a major Chinese company
                      contacted Chris and Adam. They wanted to send someone over
                      to talk about Skymind.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The company was called Tencent. If you live in China, or
                      have a connection to the country, you almost certainly
                      know about Tencent. It's the company behind QQ, the
                      popular instant messenger, and a lot of other popular
                      services.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      At the time, Tencent was a nearly $139 billion company
                      with almost a billion users. The company rivals Facebook
                      and Amazon, but most westerners have never heard of it. In
                      fact, Fast Company once described Tencent's founder, Pony
                      Ma, as perhaps "the least known multibillionaire in the
                      tech world."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The guy Tencent sent over was named Louis Fu Tong. He was
                      young, in his twenties, and he was really excited to talk
                      to Chris about Skymind. Chris, once again, found himself
                      giving his pitch, the one he'd been perfecting over all
                      those lunch-hour meetings with investors.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This time, it worked. In early 2015, Tencent decided to
                      invest $200,000.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      This was Skymind's first outside investment, and it was
                      cause to celebrate. It was also cause to make some drastic
                      changes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      With this new money, Chris was able to leave his day job
                      and work full time at Skymind. He and Adam were also able
                      to hire their first employee, an engineer to help Adam
                      make their product better. They needed to accelerate the
                      development of their product, Deeplearing4j.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      After the initial investment, Chris thought he could go
                      out and raise a lot more. But he was wrong. He kept
                      meeting with investors. He kept giving the pitch. But they
                      kept turning him down.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      So there were Chris and Adam, living on virtually nothing.

                      Somehow, they made it until the end of 2015. And by that
                      time, all the coding Adam was doing while Chris was out
                      trying to raise money began to pay off. Their product was
                      getting faster and more reliable. The number of people
                      making improvements through their open source community
                      was growing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      And then something big happened, something that would
                      change the course of their company: They got into Y
                      Combinator, a well-known startup accelerator that helps
                      founders like Chris and Adam develop their ideas and build
                      a solid business model. Think of it as a startup bootcamp.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      All that time that Chris spent knocking on doors and
                      asking for money? Suddenly, people started knocking on
                      <em>his</em> door and asking, "How much money do you
                      need?"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      When they finished Y Combinator, they had raised $3
                      million and grown the company to 10 people.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      "I'll just tell you," Chris says. "Having people knock on
                      your door after begging for a year? <em>That's</em> a
                      weird feeling."

                    Skymind now has an office in a nondescript building on the
                    edge of SOMA, not far from the Tenderloin in San Francisco.
                    It's just far enough from where startups tend to cluster to
                    be affordable. And the team has a decent amount of

                    There's a reception desk at the front of the office and two
                    large staircases to the right that lead up to a few
                    conference rooms. There are a few workstations up there, as
                    well, and a treadmill for walking while you work.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    On the bottom floor, there's a table near the kitchen with a
                    bunch of office chairs around it. This is where Chris camps
                    out. Like any startup CEO, Chris is doing a little bit of
                    everything&mdash;from writing technical documentation to
                    handling HR issues. He does almost all of it from this
                    table.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The open space near the kitchen is also where they host
                    potential customers. Whenever they have someone coming in,
                    Chris pushes the table against the wall and sets up a dozen
                    beige folding chairs, like a pop-up seminar at a local
                    library.
                  </p>

                    Skymind's success can, at least in part, be attributed to
                    Chris' ability to connect with people and explain how deep
                    learning works. He has a reporter's knack for breaking down
                    any concept down into its basic components and patiently
                    explaining each part to you.

                    "AI is just math and code that makes decisions about data,"
                    Chris says. "If you drew it out on a whiteboard, there would
                    be three parts: AI is in the middle. Data is on the left.
                    Decisions are on the right. You push data into the AI and
                    decisions come out of the other side."

                    That means that if you're a business that wants to build a
                    deep learning solution, you need two things: You need to
                    know what you care about, and you need data.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Most large companies struggle with old, hard business
                    problems. It might be fraud. It might be market forecasting.
                    It might be figuring out why certain computer chips are
                    flawed when they come off the line&mdash;and others aren't.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Companies care very deeply about these problems because a
                    lot of money is at stake. "If they're a large company,"
                    Chris says, "this could be millions of dollars, tens of
                    millions&mdash;even hundreds of millions."
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    It turns out, these are all problems that deep learning can
                    help with. If you think about it, they're basically just
                    decision problems: Does this transaction look like fraud,
                    yes or no?
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    For the AI to not just recognize fraud, but learn what fraud
                    looks like, you need data. You can't train an algorithm to
                    identify fraud if you don't have a bunch of transactions it
                    can learn from.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    So, if you give the AI data&mdash;a set of fraudulent and
                    legitimate transactions, for instance, with each kind
                    labeled&mdash;it can quickly look at the set as a whole and
                    determine the characteristics of fraud.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    That is, it can learn what fraud looks like. And once it
                    knows what fraud looks like, you can give it very, very
                    large sets of transactions that it's never seen, and it can
                    spot the ones that look suspicious.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The promise of AI is that it can do all of this faster and
                    more accurately than any human can. It can take on simple
                    tasks that humans flub because of boredom or fatigue and it
                    can perform them over and over and over and over and over.
                    And every time it correctly identifies fraud, the company
                    saves money.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    That's the moment that Chris is going for, when mountains of
                    data that companies aren't necessarily using become a
                    valuable asset. The moment when data becomes gold.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Chris had spent years trying to get on the right side of the
                    robots. And by getting companies to care about this moment,
                    that's when he had finally done it.

                    When companies saw that AI had business applications, that

                    get in on the game. Even old-school behemoths like
                    automakers and big banks saw the potential.

                    So, when your bank uses AI to determine whether a
                    transaction is fraud, you benefit from it. That call you get
                    from your bank asking you if you actually bought a $2,000
                    television on the other side of the world? That's AI.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    It's the same when Gmail automatically filters certain
                    emails into your spam filter. And when Facebook asks if you
                    want to tag your mom in the photo you just uploaded. And
                    when Alexa tells you that, yes, in fact, she will set a
                    timer for you. All of it is AI.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    It goes completely unnoticed by most, but it's happening all
                    around us. And bit by bit, our lives are getting a little
                    easier. Chris likens this to a thermostat, regulating our
                    environment, making our daily lives just a little bit
                    better.
