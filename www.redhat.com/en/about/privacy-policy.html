This Privacy Statement may not apply to open source project websites sponsored by Red Hat. Such project websites may have their own privacy statements, which we encourage you to review. In certain cases, this Privacy Statement applies to personal data collected by Red Hat when Red Hat makes this Privacy Statement or a link to the Privacy Statement available in a digital communication, paper form or in person (for example when attending an event).</p>

<h2 id="cookies">Cookies and Other Technology</h2>
<p>When you visit our websites we may automatically collect information such as your IP address, browsing
    history, information on your interaction with the website, browser type and language, operating system,
    location, date and time (i.e., the category above referred to <a href="#categories">as Internet or other similar network
    activity</a>). We may also use cookies to collect information as you navigate our websites. A cookie is a
    small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your device. The
    cookie may be placed by Red Hat or by an authorized third party. We use both session-based and
    persistent cookies on our websites. Session-based cookies exist during a single session and disappear
    when you close your browser or turn off your device. Persistent cookies remain on your device even
    after you close your browser or turn off your device.</p>
<p>Red Hat categorizes the cookies on our websites into three categories: Required, Functional and
    Advertising cookies.</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Required Cookies.</em> Required cookies are necessary to enable the basic features of the website to
        function. Red Hat uses some cookies that are required for the delivery of services on our
        websites. Cookies that are required allow us to maintain and improve the safety and security of
        our websites, authenticate account users, allow you to access your private accounts on our
        websites, allow you to sign into different portions of our websites with the use of only one login,
        balance the traffic on our websites, and remember items in your shopping cart. Cookies that are
        required are not used for marketing purposes.</li>
    <li><em>Functional Cookies.</em> Functional cookies allow us to analyze your use of the website to evaluate
        and improve our performance. Red Hat also uses functional cookies to improve our service to
        you and personalize your web browsing experience, such as by gaining a better understanding
        of your interests and requirements regarding our websites, our business or our products and
        services. Cookies that Red Hat uses to improve our services and your website experience may
        remember your language and site preferences, invite you to participate in surveys or
        evaluations, show you when you are logged into our system and allow you to remain logged-in
        for a period of time, help provide you with support services, remember your login information,
        and prepopulate forms that you have already completed. Red Hat also uses cookies that collect
        information about how you use our websites, including which pages you visit, and whether you
        experience any errors. These cookies use aggregate information to provide statistics on how our
        websites are used, help us improve our websites by measuring errors, testing different designs
        on our websites, and helping us measure the traffic on our websites so that we can optimize our
        content accordingly. These cookies are used to help us improve how our websites work,
        understand what interests our users, and measure website quality and the effectiveness of our
        online advertising.</li>
    <li><em>Advertising Cookies.</em> Advertising cookies are used to show you ads that are more relevant to
        you. We may share this information with advertisers or use it to better understand your
        interests. For example, advertising cookies may be used to share data with advertisers so that
        the ads you see are more relevant to you. In addition, we may use remarketing technology to
        advertise on other websites you may visit. In doing so, a third party may place or read a unique
        ad-serving cookie on your device and use technical information about your browser and your
        activity at a Red Hat website to serve advertisements to you on non-Red Hat websites.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not want your information to be stored by cookies, you can manage your cookie preferences
    by using the options and tools made available to you by either your web browser or Red Hat. You can
    configure your browser so that it always rejects these cookies or asks you each time whether you want
    to accept them or not. Your browser documentation includes instructions explaining how to enable,
    disable or delete cookies at the browser level (usually located within the “Help”, “Tools” or “Edit”
    facility). If a cookie manager has been implemented by Red Hat on the website you are visiting, the
    cookie tool will be displayed on the website during your visit (e.g., click the “Cookie Preferences” or
    similar link at the bottom of the website). You can use the cookie manager to set your cookie preference
    and to see a list of the cookies used on the Red Hat website. The cookie manager also provides
    information on the specific cookies used and the classification of the cookie (i.e., Required, Functional or
    Advertising). Whether you utilize the cookie manager or manage cookies at the individual browser level,
    please remember that Required cookies will remain and cannot be turned off. Please also understand
    that choosing to reject cookies may reduce the performance and functionality of our websites.</p>
<p>While Red Hat websites at this time generally do not recognize automated browser signals regarding
    tracking mechanisms, such as “do not track” instructions, you can generally express your privacy
    preferences regarding the use of most cookies and similar technology through your web browser.</p>
<p>Red Hat also uses web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about usage
    of our websites and interaction with emails from Red Hat (e.g., open rates, click through rates). Web
    beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your device, such
    as cookies, when you viewed a particular website tied to the web beacon, and a description of a website
    tied to the web beacon. For example, Red Hat may place web beacons in marketing emails that notify
    Red Hat when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of our websites. Red Hat uses web
    beacons to operate and improve our websites and email communications.</p>

<h2 id="rights">Your Rights and Choices</h2>
<p>In accordance with the laws of certain countries, you may have certain rights and choices regarding the
    personal data we collect and maintain about you, and how we communicate with you.</p>
<p>Where the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”), the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (“LGPD”), the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) or similar legal requirements apply to the processing of your personal data,
    especially when you access the website from a country in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), as a
    consumer in the state of California or in a jurisdiction with similar legal protections, you have the
    following rights, subject to some limitations, against the respective Red Hat Company responsible for
    the website you are using:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The right to request information about our use of your personal data (e.g., the pieces and
        categories of personal data we have; the categories of sources, purposes for collection, the third parties with whom we have shared personal data, and
        personal data we have disclosed);</li>
    <li>The right to review and access your personal data;</li>
    <li>The right to rectify (correct, update or modify) the personal data we hold about you;</li>
    <li>The right to erase (e.g., delete), anonymize or block your personal data;</li>
    <li>The right to restrict our use of your personal data;</li>
    <li>The right to object to our use of, or certain types of disclosures of, your personal data;</li>
    <li>The right to receive your personal data in a usable format and transmit it to a third party (also
        known as the right of data portability); and</li>
    <li>The right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may do so via our <a href="personal-data-request.html">Personal Data Request Form</a>. For
    California consumers, you may also submit requests by calling Red Hat’s U.S. toll free number at 1-800-
    546-7274.</p>
<p>Where the GDPR, LGPD, CCPA or similar legal requirements apply, you also have the right to withdraw any
    consent you have given to uses of your personal data. If you wish to withdraw consent that you have
    previously provided to us, you may do so via our <a href="../feedback.html">Feedback Form</a>. However, the withdrawal of consent
    will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p>
<p>Where the GDPR, LGPD, CCPA or similar legal requirements do not apply, Red Hat grants you the ability to
    access, modify, or update some of your personal data online at any time. You may log in and make
    changes to your information, such as your password, your contact information, your general
    preferences, and your personalization settings. If necessary, you may also contact us via our <a href="../feedback.html">Feedback
    Form</a> and describe the changes you want made to the information you have previously provided.
    However, note that changing or deleting information necessary for Red Hat to assist with support,
    services, and purchases may result in a delay or interruption in processing your requests.</p>
<p>You will be given an opportunity to tell us whether you would like to receive information, special offers,
    and promotional materials by email from Red Hat or our business partners when you create a
    redhat.com account, when you register for a service, when you provide us with your personal data, or
    when we send you a marketing email. Where required by applicable law, we will obtain adequate
    consent to provide you with these marketing materials. You also have the ability to opt out of receiving
    marketing emails from Red Hat at any time without cost by clicking on the relevant link contained in our
    marketing emails or by contacting us via our <a href="../feedback.html">Feedback Form</a>. You can also exercise your rights and
    choices by contacting us as described below under “<a href="#contact">How to Contact Us</a>.”</p>
<p>When you exercise your privacy rights, such as those conferred by the GDPR, LGPD, or the CCPA, you have a
    right not to receive discriminatory treatment by Red Hat for the exercise of such privacy rights.</p>

<p class="toTop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h2 id="verification">Verification</h2>
<p>Before responding to a request for information about your personal data, we must verify the request.
    Verification is important to protect your information and to help confirm that we are responding to a
    valid request and providing the response to the correct individual. To verify the request we initially ask
    for at least two (2) or three (3) identifiers, such as name, email address and location. If we have a need
    to request additional identifiers to reasonably verify your identity, we will contact you and request
    additional verification. The information we ask to verify your identity may depend on your relationship
    with us.</p>
<p>When you exercise your privacy rights under the GDPR, LGPD, CCPA or similar laws, you can designate an
    authorized agent or representative to make a request on your behalf by providing the authorized agent
    with written permission to do so and verifying your identity with us as part of the request, or by
    providing the authorized agent with Power of Attorney pursuant to applicable law (e.g., the California
    Probate code). We will ask the individual submitting the request to denote that they are an authorized
    agent or representative. When submitted by an authorized agent or representative, we ask the
    authorized agent or representative to provide name, email address and a description of the relationship
    with the individual who is the subject of the request and to certify that the representative has
    permission to submit the request, and may request proof of the consumer’s written permission.</p>

<p class="toTop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>Red Hat intends to protect your personal data. We have implemented appropriate physical,
    administrative and technical safeguards to help us protect your personal data from unauthorized access,
    use and disclosure. For example, we encrypt certain personal data such as payment information when
    we transmit such information over the Internet. We also require that our business partners and service
    providers protect such information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure.</p>

<p class="toTop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h2 id="social">Social Media, Public Forums and Links to Other Websites</h2>
<p>Red Hat may provide social media features that enable you to share information with your social
    networks and interact with Red Hat on various social media websites. Your use of these features may
    result in the collection or sharing of information about you, depending on the feature. We encourage
    you to review the privacy policies and settings on the social media websites with which you interact to
    make sure you understand the information that may be collected, used, and shared by those websites.</p>
<p>Our websites may make chat rooms, forums, blogs, message boards, and/or news groups available to its
    users. Remember that your comments and posts become publicly available, and we urge you to exercise
    discretion when submitting such content.</p>
<p>Our websites may contain links to other websites. Red Hat does not control and is not responsible for

    questions about the data collection procedures of linked websites, please contact the organizations that
    operate those websites directly.</p>
<p class="toTop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h2 id="children">Children’s Online Privacy</h2>

<h2 id="data">Data Transfers and Privacy Shield Frameworks</h2>
<p>Red Hat is a global organization, with legal entities, business processes, and technical systems that
    operate across borders. Red Hat may transfer your personal data to other Red Hat entities in the United
    States and elsewhere. The United States and other countries may not have the same data protection
    laws as the country from which you initially provided the information.</p>
<p>Where required by applicable law, we have put in place appropriate safeguards (such as standard
    contractual clauses approved by the European Commission) in accordance with applicable legal
    requirements to ensure that your data is adequately protected. When transferring your personal data
    internationally, Red Hat will protect your personal data as provided in this Privacy Statement. If you wish
