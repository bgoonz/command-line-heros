            <h2 id="scope">General Terms and Conditions</h2>

            <p><strong>Master Agreement:</strong> All terms and conditions of your master agreement with Red Hat that governs your purchase of Training (for instance the Red Hat Enterprise Agreement available at <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/agreements" title="Red Hat Enterprise Agreement">https://www.redhat.com/en/about/agreements</a>) and Red Hat’s Appendix 2A: Training and Training Units, apply to the purchase and consumption of Red Hat Training, in addition to the policies herein (these “Policies”). Capitalized terms that are used in these Policies but are not defined have the meanings given to those terms in your master agreement and Red Hat’s Appendix 2A.</p>

            <p><strong>Modifications and Updates to the Training Policies:</strong> Red Hat reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or update these Policies either by posting a revised version of these Policies at <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/red-hat-training-policies" title="Red Hat Training Policies">https://www.redhat.com/en/about/red-hat-training-policies</a> or by providing notice by other reasonable means.  If you do not agree to the modified or updated Policies, then (a) the existing Policies will continue to apply to the Training you purchased as of the date of the modification or update for the remainder of the then-current Training term(s), and (b) the updated Policies will apply to any new purchases or renewals of Training made after the effective date of the updated Policies.</p>


            <p><strong>Cancellation and Rescheduling of Classes by Red Hat:</strong>  Red Hat may cancel or reschedule a class, including a component of a Bundle, at its discretion. In the event of such cancellation, Red Hat will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide notice of such cancellation fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the class start date. Client will not be charged for the Red Hat cancellation or rescheduling. Red Hat is not liable for expenses incurred for Client’s travel expenses or hotel accommodations in the event that Red Hat cancels or reschedules an event.</p>

            <p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Client is responsible for ensuring it meets the requirements of the event in which it is enrolling. Red Hat offers skills assessments that help guide Client in enrolling in the proper course for their background. Additionally, Client can contact its local Red Hat Training sales representative for further guidance.</p>

            <p><strong>Right of Dismissal:</strong> In order to maintain a classroom environment that is conducive to learning, Red Hat reserves the right to dismiss a participant from any Red Hat training or exam event. A participant who harasses other participant(s) or instructor(s), or who in Red Hat's sole judgment acts inappropriately or disruptively during class, may be dismissed from the event and may not return to the premises. In case of such dismissal, Red Hat’s liability will be limited to the refunding of fees paid by Client for the course or exam, and Red Hat shall not be responsible for any consequential loss or inconvenience arising whatsoever.</p>

            <p><strong>Special Accommodations Policy:</strong> Red Hat may make special accommodations, on a case-by-case basis, for open enrollment classroom students, classroom exam candidates and Red Hat Individual Exam candidates, who have special needs. Participants with special needs should notify Red Hat of such needs a minimum of two weeks prior to their desired class/exam by filling out a Special Accommodations Request (SAR) form. In the case of special needs of a medical nature, a participant must have their medical/rehabilitation professional fill out a <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/special-accommodations-request-sar-form" title="Special Accommodations Request (SAR) form">Special Accommodations Request (SAR) form</a>.

                    <p><strong>Identity Authentication:</strong> A photo of the Named Participant will be taken prior to the start of the exam and the Named Participant must present a current government issued photo identification (preferably a valid passport). Government issued identification that uses non-Latin characters must be verified by a local Red Hat representative at the testing location or the online proctor in the case of Red Hat Remote Exams prior to the Named Participant taking a Red Hat exam.</p>

                <li>
                    <p><strong id="monitoring">Individual Exam Monitoring:</strong> By taking a Red Hat Individual Exam Named Participant will be monitored in real time by a combination of a human proctor and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect cheating or content theft during exams in order to protect Red Hat’s legitimate interest in the integrity of its testing and certification processes.  Both AI and human proctors will monitor video and audio streams of Named Participant while taking the exam to detect behaviors that might indicate misconduct, such as the presence of another person in the room or eye movements that suggest Named Participant might be consulting notes or other prohibited materials.  AI will only be used for the purpose of providing an alert to human proctors that a behavior has been observed that might indicate misconduct, but AI will not take actions or make decisions about Named Participant’s exam session. These will only be made by one or more remote human proctors.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Communication with the proctor is available in several languages. The proctor will guide Named Participant through the onboarding process using live video. The proctor (a human) has the discretion to immediately terminate the exam if a Named Participant is suspected of cheating or any type of misconduct. Such violations will be immediately reported to the Red Hat Certification team, which may result in penalties including, but not limited to, nullification of exam results and revocation of exam pass status and certification.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Prior to starting the Red Hat Individual Exam, Named Participants will be presented with a Red Hat Exam Privacy & Confidentiality Agreement where they will be asked to review and confirm that they will comply with the terms of the confidentiality of Red Hat exams as listed above under <a href="#confidentiality">Confidentiality of Red Hat Certification and Preliminary Exams</a> in addition to the terms below.
Named Participants will be asked to acknowledge and agree to the taking of video recordings of their face, image, desk, workspace and possible audio recordings during the exam for Red Hat’s legitimate interests in processing such data for the purposes of exam quality, security and the integrity of the exam process. In order to proceed with taking a Red Hat exam, Named Participants are asked to acknowledge and agree to being continuously by video and audio in real time by a combination of a human proctor and Artificial Intelligence (AI) engine while taking the exam (more details on the use of AI are immediately above under “Individual Exam Monitoring”), the processing of such personal data by Red Hat and its third party data processors, and the transfer of such data to Red Hat and its authorized third party data processors in the United States or other countries where they are located. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Named Participants are asked to acknowledge that they have no expectation of privacy as regards their face, image, audio or actions during the exam, and agree to waive any and all claims asserting a violation of their right to privacy during the exam insofar as such claims pertain to the recording of their face, image, audio or actions during the exam. If Named Participants do not agree to be recorded by video or audio for the purposes as described, they will not be allowed to proceed with the exam.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Maintenance of Exam Data and Digital Artifacts:</strong> Red Hat saves and stores various digital artifacts associated with Individual Exams, including disk images for the virtual machines used during an exam, the video recording of the exam session, and chat logs, among other elements. Due to the constraints of local storage capacity, Red Hat cannot guarantee the maintenance of any artifacts for any specific period of time.  Red Hat is also not responsible for the loss of digital artifacts due to causes beyond Red Hat’s reasonable control, including, but not necessarily limited to, hosting facility error or negligence, fire, theft, vandalism, war, acts of foreign governments, or other force majeure events.</p>
            <p>Individual Exams are subject to the Red Hat Exam Privacy and Confidentiality Agreement. Violation of these policies or other behavior that suggests misconduct may result in the remote monitor pausing or terminating an exam.</p>

            <p><strong>Red Hat Remote Exams</strong></p>
            <p>Red Hat Remote Exams provide an individual online testing option that is both convenient and flexible.  A Named Participant is responsible for providing their own device and connectivity. Red Hat Remote Exams are certification exams delivered through a configured and restricted live environment for the sole purpose of delivering the Red Hat Remote Exam. Nothing is installed on Named Participants’ systems during the exam session and Red Hat does not save any information or hold any information on the devices after Named Participants log out from their exam session.</p>

            <p><strong>Red Hat Remote Exam-Specific Compatibility Test:</strong> Named Participants are required to run a compatibility test from within the Remote Exam live environment in advance of their scheduled exam date preferably at the same time of day as the scheduled exam. This allows Named Participants to check the compatibility of the hardware and network that they plan on using to take the exam.  Named Participants can only proceed with their scheduled Red Hat Remote Exam if their compatibility test is successful. It is therefore imperative to ensure that the compatibility test is completed in advance of the scheduled exam. Named Participants are advised to cancel the scheduled exam and not to reschedule until they have resolved the issues raised by the compatibility test. A successful run of the compatibility tool does not guarantee the absence of issues when the exam is delivered. Because Named Participants will use their personally provided device, location and network, Red Hat cannot troubleshoot these for any of the Named Participants. In the event there are problems that significantly impede Named Participants’ ability to take the exam, Red Hat at its sole discretion will allow the Named Participant to discontinue and reschedule the exam at a later date.</p>

            <p><strong>Red Hat Remote Exam System and Hardware Requirements:</strong></p> 
                <ul>
                <li>

Red Hat may update these requirements from time to time at Red Hat’s sole discretion.  It is the responsibility of the Named Participant to ensure that their device and connectivity meet any requirements published by Red Hat.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>The hardware requirements include the use of one external web camera.  Any sustained interruption of the web camera feed may result in the termination of the exam session without refund.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
              <p><strong>Red Hat Remote Exam Workspace Policy:</strong></p> 
                <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>In addition to the above policy regarding “Wearing/Use of Personal Devices in Testing Locations”, Named Participants taking a Red Hat Remote Exam will need to ensure that there are no Smart devices, writing instruments or objects (including but not limited to pens, pencils, markers), printed materials (including but not limited to paper, sticky notes, notepads, books, memo cards), or any items on the wall with writing (including but not limited to whiteboards or pictures) in close proximity or on their desks or in their workspace. If a Named Participant’s workspace does not pass a room scan, they will not be permitted to proceed with the exam.   Suitability of the exam workspace is entirely at Red Hat’s discretion and an exam may be cancelled or rescheduled for any of the aforementioned reasons or for reasons other than those mentioned herein.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Only one physical display will be allowed for the exam. Named Participants must turn off and unplug any additional laptops, computers, monitors, displays or any other personal equipment or hardware in their workspace other than the computer or laptop used for the exam. Named Participants will not be allowed to proceed with the Remote Exam until the requirement specified herein is met.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>NO GUARANTEE:</strong> NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN OR IN RED HAT AND CLIENT’S AGREEMENT, RED HAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT RED HAT EXAM SESSION STREAMS WILL BE PROVIDED UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, EVEN FOR NAMED PARTICIPANTS WHO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE COMPATIBILITY TESTING PROCESS PRIOR TO THE EXAM START DATE.</p>

            <p><strong>Red Hat Remote Exam-Specific Disclaimers:</strong></p> 
                <ul>
                <li>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Red Hat cannot assume responsibility for the proper functioning of a Named Participant’s network. Named Participants must choose a reliable network and are required to run the compatibility test to ensure a suitable environment. Should network connectivity problems arise within the first 30 minutes of the exam and the Named Participant is unable to resolve the connectivity problems, they can request to have the exam attempt discontinued and will be allowed to reschedule the Red Hat exam.</p>
                </li>

                 <li>
                    <p>Red Hat is not responsible for damage or other impact to a Named Participant’s device while connected to the Red Hat remote testing environment, or after they have logged off and out of the Red Hat remote testing environment, or as a result of taking the Red Hat Remote Exam, including but not limited to: the device being hacked;  the device infected by any malicious software; any loss of data or any changes in the operation of a Named Participant’s device.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Non-availability of Red Hat Remote Exams in People’s Republic of China:</strong> Red Hat Remote Exams are not available or approved for sale or delivery or guaranteed for access in the People’s Republic of China.
