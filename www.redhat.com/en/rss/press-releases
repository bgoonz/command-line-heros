  <link>https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-extends-red-hat-enterprise-linux-8-foundation-more-secure-computing-second-fips-140-2-validation</link>
  <description>Red Hat, Inc., the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced the renewal of the Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 (FIPS 140-2) security validation for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2. The second FIPS certification for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 platform, this validation indicates Red Hat’s leadership and commitment to providing a more secure backbone for the innovation of open hybrid cloud.

Driven by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), FIPS 140-2 is a computer security standard that specifies the requirements for cryptographic modules -- including both hardware and software components -- used within a security system to protect sensitive information. This validation is needed when agencies determine that specific information systems should use cryptography to protect data; if cryptography is required, then it must be validated.</description>
